A Collect for Resurrection Hope 
(Sunday)

Lord God, whose Son our Savior Jesus Christ triumphed over
the powers of death and prepared for us our place in the new
Jerusalem: Grant that we, who have this day given thanks for his
resurrection, may praise you in that City of which he is the light,
and where he lives and reigns for ever and ever. Amen.
