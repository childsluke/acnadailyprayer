VENITE

O come, let us sing unto the Lord; *
	let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving *
	and show ourselves glad in him with psalms.
For the Lord is a great God *
	and a great King above all gods.
In his hand are all the depths of the earth *
	and the heights of the hills are his also.
The sea is his, for he made it, *
	and his hands prepared the dry land.
O come, let us worship and fall down, *
	and kneel before the Lord our Maker.
For he is our God, *
	and we are the people of his pasture,
	and the sheep of his hand.

Today, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts *
	as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness,
When your fathers tested me, *
	and put me to the proof, though they had seen my works.
Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, *
	“It is a people that err in their hearts,
	for they have not known my ways,”
Of whom I swore in my wrath *
	that they should not enter into my rest.
