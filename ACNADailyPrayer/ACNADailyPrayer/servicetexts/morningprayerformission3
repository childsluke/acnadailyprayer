PRAYER FOR MISSION

Lord Jesus Christ, you stretched out your arms of love on the
hard wood of the Cross that everyone might come within the
reach of your saving embrace: So clothe us in your Spirit that 
we, reaching forth our hands in love, may bring those who do
not know you to the knowledge and love of you; for the honor
of your Name. Amen.
