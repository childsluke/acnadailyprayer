PHOS HILARON
(O Gladsome Light)

O gladsome light,
pure brightness of the everliving Father in heaven, *
	O Jesus Christ, holy and blessed!
Now as we come to the setting of the sun, and our eyes behold the vesper light, *
	we sing your praises, O God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. 
You are worthy at all times to be praised by happy voices, *
	O Son of God, O Giver of Life,
	and to be glorified through all the worlds.
