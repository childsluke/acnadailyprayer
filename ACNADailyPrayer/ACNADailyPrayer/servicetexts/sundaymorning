A Collect for Strength to Await Christâ€™s Return
(Sunday)

O God our King, by the resurrection of your Son Jesus Christ
on the first day of the week, you conquered sin, put death to
flight, and gave us the hope of everlasting life: Redeem all our
days by this victory; forgive our sins, banish our fears, make
us bold to praise you and to do your will; and steel us to wait
for the consummation of your kingdom on the last great Day;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
