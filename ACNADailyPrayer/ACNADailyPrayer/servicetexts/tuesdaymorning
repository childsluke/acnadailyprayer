A Collect for Peace 
(Tuesday)

O God, the author of peace and lover of concord, to know you
is eternal life and to serve you is perfect freedom: Defend us,
your humble servants, in all assaults of our enemies; that we,
surely trusting in your defense, may not fear the power of any
adversaries, through the might of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
