TE DEUM LAUDAMUS
(We Praise You, O God)

We praise you, O God; we acclaim you as Lord; *
	all creation worships you, the Father everlasting.
To you all angels, all the powers of heaven, *
	the cherubim and seraphim, sing in endless praise:
Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of power and might, *
	heaven and earth are full of your glory.  
   
The glorious company of apostles praise you. *
The noble fellowship of prophets praise you.
The white-robed army of martyrs praise you. *
Throughout the world the holy Church acclaims you:
	Father, of majesty unbounded,
	your true and only Son, worthy of all praise, * 
	and the Holy Spirit, advocate and guide.

You, Christ, are the king of glory, *
	the eternal Son of the Father.    
When you took our flesh to set us free *
	you humbly chose the Virgin’s womb.
You overcame the sting of death *
	and opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers. 
	You are seated at God’s right hand in glory. *
	We believe that you will come to be our judge.
Come then, Lord, and help your people, *
	bought with the price of your own blood, 
	and bring us with your saints *
	to glory everlasting.

The following verses may be omitted:

Save your people, Lord, and bless your inheritance;* 
	govern and uphold them now and always.
Day by day we bless you; *
	we praise your Name for ever. 
Keep us today, Lord, from all sin; *
	have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy.
Lord, show us your love and mercy, *
	for we have put our trust in you.
In you, Lord, is our hope; *
	let us never be put to shame.
