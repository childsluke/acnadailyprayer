PRAYER FOR MISSION

Almighty and everlasting God, who alone works great marvels: Send down upon our clergy 
and the congregations committed to their charge the life-giving Spirit of your grace, 
shower them with the continual dew of your blessing, and ignite in them 
a zealous love of your Gospel; 
through Jesus Christ our Lord. â€‰Amen.
