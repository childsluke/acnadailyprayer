A Collect for the Renewal of Life 
(Monday)

O God, the King eternal, whose light divides the day from the
night and turns the shadow of death into the morning: 
Drive far from us all wrong desires, incline our hearts 
to keep your law, and guide our feet into the way of peace; 
that, having done your will with cheerfulness during the day, 
we may,  when night comes, rejoice to give you thanks; 
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
