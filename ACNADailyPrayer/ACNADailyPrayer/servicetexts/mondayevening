A Collect for Peace 
(Monday)

O God, the source of all holy desires, all good counsels, and
all just works: Give to your servants that peace which the
world cannot give, that our hearts may be set to obey your
commandments, and that we, being defended from the fear of
our enemies, may pass our time in rest and quietness; through
the merits of Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.
