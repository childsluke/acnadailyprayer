PRAYER FOR MISSION

O God, you have made of one blood all the peoples of the earth,
and sent your blessed Son to preach peace to those who are far
off and to those who are near: Grant that people everywhere
may seek after you and find you; bring the nations into your
fold; pour out your Spirit upon all flesh; and hasten the coming
of your kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
