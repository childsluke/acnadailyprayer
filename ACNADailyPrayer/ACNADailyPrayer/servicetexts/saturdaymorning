A Collect for Sabbath Rest 
(Saturday)

Almighty God, who after the creation of the world rested from
all your works and sanctified a day of rest for all your creatures:
Grant that we, putting away all earthly anxieties, may be duly
prepared for the service of your sanctuary, and that our rest here
upon earth may be a preparation for the eternal rest promised to
your people in heaven; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
