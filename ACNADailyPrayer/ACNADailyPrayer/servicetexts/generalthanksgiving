GENERAL THANKSGIVING

Almighty God, Father of all mercies,
	we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks for all your goodness and loving-kindness
	to us and to all whom you have made.    
We bless you for our creation, preservation,
	and all the blessings of this life;
	but above all for your immeasurable love
	in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ; 
	for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.
And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies, 
	that with truly thankful hearts
	we may show forth your praise,
	not only with our lips, but in our lives, 
	by giving up our selves to your service, 
	and by walking before you
	in holiness and righteousness all our days; 
Through Jesus Christ our Lord,
	to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,
	be honor and glory throughout all ages. Amen.
