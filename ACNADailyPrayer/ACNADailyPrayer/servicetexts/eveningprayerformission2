PRAYER FOR MISSION

Keep watch, dear Lord, with those who work, or watch, or weep
this night, and give your angels charge over those who sleep.
Tend the sick, Lord Christ; give rest to the weary, bless the
dying, soothe the suffering, pity the afflicted, shield the joyous;
and all for your loveâ€™s sake. Amen.
