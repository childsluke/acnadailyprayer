A Collect for Endurance 
(Friday)

Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but
first he suffered pain, and entered not into glory before he was
crucified: Mercifully grant that we, walking in the way of the
Cross, may find it none other than the way of life and peace;
through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord. Amen.
