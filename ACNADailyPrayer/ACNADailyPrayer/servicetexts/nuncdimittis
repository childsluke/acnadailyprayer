NUNC DIMITTIS

Lord, now let your servant depart in peace, * 
	according to your word.
For my eyes have seen your salvation, *
	which you have prepared before the face of all people; 
To be a light to lighten the Gentiles, *
	and to be the glory of your people Israel.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; *
	as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, 
	world without end. Amen.

(Luke 2: 29-32)
