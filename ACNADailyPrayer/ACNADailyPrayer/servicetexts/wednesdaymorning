A Collect for Grace 
(Wednesday)

O Lord, our heavenly Father, almighty and everlasting God, you
have brought us safely to the beginning of this day: Defend us
by your mighty power, that we may not fall into sin nor run into
any danger; and that, guided by your Spirit, we may do what is
righteous in your sight; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
