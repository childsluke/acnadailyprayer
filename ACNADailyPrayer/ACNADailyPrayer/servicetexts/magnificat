MAGNIFICAT
(The Song of Mary)

My soul magnifies the Lord, *
	and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; 
For he has regarded *
	the lowliness of his handmaiden.
For behold, from now on, *
	all generations will call me blessed;    
For he that is mighty has magnified me, *
	and holy is his Name.
And his mercy is on those who fear him, * 
	throughout all generations.
He has shown the strength of his arm; *
	he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
He has brought down the mighty from their thrones, *
	and has exalted the humble and meek.   
He has filled the hungry with good things, *
	and the rich he has sent empty away.
He, remembering his mercy, has helped his servant Israel, *     
	as he promised to our fathers, Abraham and his seed for ever.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; * 
	as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,
	world without end. Amen.

(Luke 1:46-55)
