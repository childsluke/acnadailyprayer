A Collect for Guidance 
(Thursday)

Heavenly Father, in you we live and move and have our being:
We humbly pray you so to guide and govern us by your Holy
Spirit, that in all the cares and occupations of our life we may
not forget you, but may remember that we are ever walking in
your sight; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
