A Collect for Protection 
(Wednesday)

O God, the life of all who live, the light of the faithful, the
strength of those who labor, and the repose of the dead: We
thank you for the blessings of the day that is past, and humbly
ask for your protection through the coming night. Bring us in
safety to the morning hours; through him who died and rose
again for us, your Son our Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.
