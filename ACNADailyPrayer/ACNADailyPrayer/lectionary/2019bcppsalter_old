Psalm 1
1 Blessed is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly * 
	nor stood in the way of sinners, and has not sat in the seat of the scornful;
2 But his delight is in the law of the Lord, * 
	and on his law will he meditate day and night.
3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the waterside, * 
	that will bring forth his fruit in due season.
4 His leaf also shall not wither; * 
	and look, whatever he does, it shall prosper.
5 As for the ungodly, it is not so with them; * 
	but they are like the chaff, which the wind scatters away from 
         the face of the earth.
6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment; * 
	neither the sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
7 For the Lord knows the way of the righteous, * 
	but the way of the ungodly shall perish.

Psalm 2
1 Why do the nations so furiously rage together? * 
	And why do the peoples devise a vain thing?
2 The kings of the earth stand up, 
    and the rulers take counsel together, * 
		against the Lord and against his Anointed:
3 “Let us break their bonds asunder * 
	and cast away their cords from us.”
4 He who dwells in heaven shall laugh them to scorn; * 
	the Lord shall hold them in derision.
5 Then shall he speak to them in his wrath * 
	and terrify them in his great anger:
6 “I myself have set my King * 
	upon my holy hill of Zion.”
7 I will proclaim the decree of the Lord; * 
	he said to me, “You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.
8 Ask of me, and I shall give you the nations for your inheritance * 
	and the ends of the earth for your possession.
9 You shall bruise them with a rod of iron * 
	and break them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”
10 Be wise now, O you kings; * 
	be warned, you judges of the earth.
11 Serve the Lord in fear * 
	and rejoice with trembling.
12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way; 
    for his wrath is quickly kindled. * 
Blessed are all those who put their trust in him.


Psalm 3
1 Lord, how they are increased who trouble me; * 
	many are those who rise against me.
2 Many there are who say of my soul, * 
	“There is no help for him in his God.”
3 But you, O Lord, are my defender; * 
	you are my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.
4 I called upon the Lord with my voice, * 
	and he heard me from his holy hill.
5 I lay down and slept, and rose up again, * 
	for the Lord sustained me.
6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people * 
	who have set themselves against me round about.
7 Rise up, O Lord, and help me, O my God; * 
    for you smite all my enemies on the cheek-bone; 
		you have broken the teeth of the ungodly.
8 Salvation belongs to the Lord; * 
	may your blessing be upon your people.


Psalm 4
1 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness; * 
you set me free when I was in trouble; 
         have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
2 O you children of men, how long will you blaspheme my honor * 
	and have such pleasure in vanity, and seek after falsehood?
3 Know this also, that the Lord has chosen for himself 
    the one that is godly; * 
		when I call upon the Lord, he will hear me.
4 Stand in awe, and sin not; * 
	commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still.
5 Offer the sacrifice of righteousness * 
	and put your trust in the Lord.
6 There are many that say, “Who will show us any good?” * 
	Lord, lift up the light of your countenance upon us.
7 You have put gladness in my heart, * 
	more than when others’ grain and wine and oil increased.
8 I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest; * 
	for you, Lord, only, make me dwell in safety.




Psalm 5
1 Give ear to my words, O Lord; * 
	consider my meditation.
2 O hearken unto the voice of my calling, my King and my God,* 
	for unto you will I make my prayer.
3 My voice shall you hear in the morning, O Lord; * 
	early in the morning will I direct my prayer unto you, 
         and will look up.
4 For you are not a god who has pleasure in wickedness, * 
	neither shall any evil dwell with you.
5 The boastful shall not stand in your sight, * 
	for you hate all those who work iniquity.
6 You shall destroy those who speak lies; * 
	the Lord will abhor the bloodthirsty and the deceitful.
7 But as for me, through the multitude of your mercies I will come 
    into your house; *
		and in reverence will I bow myself toward your holy temple.
8 Lead me, O Lord, in your righteousness, because of my enemies; *
	make your way straight before my face.
9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; * 
	their heart is eaten up with wickedness.
10 Their throat is an open sepulcher; * 
	they flatter with their tongue.
11 Declare them guilty, O God; 
    let them fall because of their own devices. *
Because of the multitude of their transgressions cast them out, 
         for they have rebelled against you.
12 But let all those who put their trust in you rejoice; * 
	let them ever give thanks because you defend them; 
		those who love your Name shall be joyful in you.
13 For you, Lord, will give your blessing unto the righteous, * 
	and with your favorable kindness 
		you will defend him as with a shield.


Psalm 6
1 O Lord, rebuke me not in your indignation, * 
	neither chasten me in your displeasure.
2 Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak; * 
	O Lord, heal me, for my bones are racked.
3 My soul also is greatly troubled; * 
	but, Lord, how long will you punish me?
4 Turn, O Lord, and deliver my soul; * 
	O save me for your mercy’s sake.
5 For in death no one remembers you, * 
	and who will give you thanks in the grave?
6 I am weary with my groaning; * 
	every night I flood my bed and drench my couch with my tears.
7 My eyes have become dim because of trouble, * 
	and worn away because of all my enemies.
8 Away from me, all you who work wickedness, * 
	for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping.
9 The Lord has heard my petition; * 
	the Lord will receive my prayer.
10 All my enemies shall be confounded, and greatly vexed; * 
	they shall be turned back, and put to shame suddenly.


Psalm 7
1 O Lord my God, in you have I put my trust; * 
	save me from all those who persecute me, and deliver me,
2 Lest they devour me like a lion and tear me in pieces, * 
	while there is none to help.
3 O Lord my God, if I have done any such thing, * 
	if there be any wickedness in my hands,
4 If I have repaid evil to him who has dealt with me as a friend, * 
	or plundered him who without any cause is my enemy,
5 Then let my enemy pursue me and overtake me, *
	let him trample my life into the ground, 
         and lay my honor in the dust.
6 Stand up, O Lord, in your wrath, 
    and lift yourself up against the fury of my enemies; *
		rise up for me in the judgment that you have commanded.
7 Then shall the assembly of the peoples be gathered about you;*
	lift yourself up again, O Lord, you judge of all the nations.
8 Give sentence for me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, *
	and according to the innocence that is in me.
9 O let the wickedness of the ungodly come to an end; * 
	but establish the just.
10 For the righteous God *
	tries the very hearts and minds.
11 God is my shield and my defense; *
	he preserves those who are true of heart.
12 God is a righteous judge, strong and patient; * 
	and God is provoked every day.
13 If a man will not repent, God will whet his sword; * 
	he will bend his bow, and make it ready.
14 He has prepared for him the instruments of death;* 
	he makes his arrows shafts of fire.
15 Behold, the ungodly is in labor with mischief; *
	he has conceived wickedness and brought forth lies.
16 He has made a pit and dug it out, *
	but will himself fall into the trap that he made for other
17 For his malice shall come upon his own head, * 
	and his wickedness shall fall on his own scalp.
18 I will give thanks unto the Lord, according to his righteousness; *
	and I will praise the Name of the Lord Most High.


Psalm 8
1 O Lord our Governor, how excellent is your Name in all the world; *
	you have set your glory above the heavens!
2 Out of the mouth of babes and infants you have ordained strength, 
    because of your enemies, *
		that you might still the enemy and the avenger.
3 When I consider your heavens, even the works of your fingers, *
	the moon and the stars, which you have ordained.
4 What is man, that you are mindful of him; *
	the son of man, that you visit him?
5 You made him little lower than the angels, * 
	to crown him with glory and honor.
6 You made him to have dominion over the works of your hands,* 
	and you have put all things in subjection under his feet;
7 All sheep and oxen, *
	even the beasts of the field;
8 The birds of the air, and the fish of the sea; *
	and whatsoever walks through the paths of the seas.
9 O Lord our Governor, *
	how excellent is your Name in all the world!


Psalm 9
1 I will give thanks unto you, O Lord, with my whole heart; *
	I will speak of all your marvelous works.
2 I will be glad and rejoice in you; *
	indeed, my songs will I sing of your Name, O Most High.
3 When my enemies are driven back, *
	they shall fall and perish at your presence;
4 For you have maintained my right and my cause; * 
	you sit on your throne judging right.
5 You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the ungodly; * 
	you have blotted out their name for ever and ever.
6 As for the enemy, their destruction has come; they are in perpetual ruin; *
	like the cities which you have destroyed, their memory has perished with them.
7 But the Lord sits enthroned for ever; * 
	he has prepared his seat for judgment.
8 For he shall judge the world in righteousness, * 
	and minister true judgment to the peoples.
9 The Lord will be a defense for the oppressed, * 
	even a refuge in the time of trouble;
10 And those who know your Name will put their trust in you, * 
	for you, Lord, have never failed those who seek you.
11 O praise the Lord who dwells in Zion; * 
	tell the peoples what things he has done.
12 For when he takes vengeance for blood, he remembers them, * 
	and forgets not the cry of the poor.
13 Have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider the trouble I suffer from 
    those who hate me, *
		O you who lift me up from the gates of death,
14 That I may tell of all your praises 
    within the gates of the daughter of Zion; *
		I will rejoice in your salvation.
15 The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made; *
	in the same net which they hid secretly is their foot caught.
16 The Lord is known to execute judgment; *
	the ungodly are trapped in the works of their own hands.
17 The wicked shall return to the grave, * 
	even all the peoples that forget God.
18 For the poor shall not always be forgotten; *
	the patient hope of the meek shall not perish for ever.
19 Rise up, O Lord, and let them not have the upper hand; * 
	let the nations be judged in your sight.
20 Put them in fear, O Lord, *
	that the nations may know themselves to be merely human.
Psalm 10
1 Why do you stand so far off, O Lord, *
	and hide your face in the time of need and trouble?
2 The ungodly in his pride persecutes the poor; *
	let him be taken in the crafty schemes that he has imagined.
3  For the ungodly has boasted of his own heart’s desire; *
	the covetous holds the Lord in contempt 
         and blasphemes his Name.
4 The ungodly is so proud that he cares not for God; * 
	neither is God in any of his thoughts.
5 His ways are always grievous; *
	your judgments are far above, out of his sight, and therefore he 
         defies all his enemies.
6 For he has said in his heart, “I shall never be cast down; * 
	no harm shall happen to me.”
7 His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and fraud; * 
	under his tongue are ungodliness and vanity.
8 He sits lurking in the thievish corners of the streets, and in his 
    hiding places he murders the innocent; *
		his eyes are set against the poor.
9 For he lies waiting secretly, even as a lion lurks in his den, * 
	that he may ravish the poor.
10 He ravishes the poor *
	when he gets him into his net.
11 The innocent is crushed and humbled before him, * 
	and the weak cannot stand against his might.
12 He has said in his heart, “God has forgotten; *
	he hides away his face, and he will never see it.”
13 Arise, O Lord God, and lift up your hand; * 
	forget not the poor.
14 Why should the wicked blaspheme God, *
	while he says in his heart, “You, O God, do not care”?
15 Surely you have seen it, for you behold ungodliness and wrong,* 
	that you may take the matter into your hand.
16 The poor commits himself unto you, * 
	for you are the helper of the fatherless.
17 Break the power of the ungodly and malicious; *
	search out his ungodliness until you have brought it all to light.
18 The Lord is King for ever and ever, *
	and the nations have perished out of the land.
19 O Lord, you have heard the desire of the poor; *
	you prepare their heart, and your ear hearkens to it,
20 To help the fatherless and poor with justice, *
	that the one who is of the earth may terrify no more.


Psalm 11
1 In the Lord I put my trust; *
	how then can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird unto the hill;
2 For behold, the ungodly bend their bow, and make ready their 
    arrow upon the string, *
		that they may secretly shoot at those who are true of heart.
3 For the foundations will be cast down, * 
	and what can the righteous do?”
4 The Lord is in his holy temple; * 
	the Lord’s throne is in heaven.
5 His eyes consider the poor, *
	and his eyelids try the children of men.
6 The Lord tests the righteous, *
	but the ungodly, and those who delight in wickedness, 
         his soul abhors.
7 Upon the ungodly he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, 
    storm and tempest; *
		this shall be their portion to drink.
8 For the righteous Lord loves righteousness; * 
	the upright shall behold his face.


Psalm 12
1 Help me, O Lord, for there is no godly one left; *
	for the faithful have vanished from among the children of men.
2 They speak falsely, every one with his neighbor; *
	they flatter with their lips and deceive with a double heart.
3 The Lord shall root out all deceitful lips * 
	and the tongues that speak proud things,
4 Which have said, “With our tongue will we prevail; * 
	our lips are our own; who is lord over us?”
5 “Now because of the trouble of the needy * 
	and because of the deep sighing of the poor,
6 I will rise up,” says the Lord, *
	“and will give help to every one who longs for it.”
7 The words of the Lord are pure words, 
    even as silver that is tried in the furnace *
		and as gold that is purified seven times in the fire.
8 Preserve us, O Lord, and save us *
	from this perverse and evil generation.
9 The ungodly walk on every side *
	when wickedness is exalted among the children of men.


Psalm 13
1 How long will you utterly forget me, O Lord? * 
	How long will you hide your face from me?
2 How long shall I seek counsel in my soul 
    and be so vexed in my heart? *
		How long shall my enemy triumph over me?
3 Consider and hear me, O Lord my God; *
	give light to my eyes, that I sleep not in death,
4 Lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him”; *
	for if I am cast down, those who trouble me will rejoice.
5 But my trust is in your mercy, *
	and my heart is joyful in your salvation.
6 I will sing of the Lord, because he has dealt so lovingly with me; *
	indeed, I will praise the Name of the Lord Most High.


Psalm 14
1 The fool has said in his heart, * 
	“There is no God.”
2 They are corrupt and have become abominable in their doings;* 
	there is none that does good, no not one.
3 The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, * 
	to see if there were any who would 
         understand and seek after God.
4 But they have all gone astray; 
    they have altogether become abominable; *
		there is none that does good, no not one.
5 Have they no knowledge, all those workers of evil,*
	who eat up my people as bread, and call not upon the Lord?
6 There were they brought into great fear, even where no fear was;* 
	for God is in the generation of the righteous.
7 Though you have made a mockery of the counsel of the poor, * 
	yet they put their trust in the Lord.
8 Who shall give salvation unto Israel out of Zion? * 
	When the Lord restores his captive people, 
         then shall Jacob rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.


Psalm 15
1 LORD, who shall dwell in your tabernacle? * 
	Or who shall rest upon your holy hill? 
2 Whoever leads an uncorrupt life,* 
	and does that which is right, 
         and speaks the truth from his heart.
3 He has not spoken deceitfully with his tongue, 
	nor done evil to his neighbor, * 
         and has not slandered his neighbor.
4 In his eyes the wicked is rejected, * 
	and he makes much of those who fear the LORD.
5 He swears to his neighbor and disappoints him not,* 
	though it were to his own hindrance.
6 He has not given his money for usury, * 
	nor taken a bribe against the innocent.
7 Whoever does these things * 
	shall never be overthrown.


Psalm 16
1 Preserve me, O God, *
	for in you have I put my trust.
2 O my soul, you have said unto the Lord, *
	“You are my Lord; I have no good apart from you.”
3 All my delight is upon the saints who are on the earth, * 
	and upon those who excel in virtue.
4 But those who run after another god * 
	shall have great trouble.
5 Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, * 
	neither make mention of their names with my lips.
6 The Lord himself is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup; *
	you shall maintain my lot.
7 The boundaries have fallen for me in pleasant places; * 
	indeed, I have a goodly heritage.
8 I will thank the Lord for giving me counsel; * 
	my heart also chastens me in the night season.
9 I have set the Lord always before me; *
	he is at my right hand, therefore I shall not fall.
10 Therefore, my heart is glad and my soul rejoices. * 
	My flesh also shall rest in hope.
11 For you shall not leave my soul in the grave, *
	neither shall you allow your Holy One to see corruption.
12 You shall show me the path of life; 
    in your presence is the fullness of joy, *
		and at your right hand there is pleasure for evermore.


Psalm 17 
1 Hear what is right, O Lord; consider my complaint; * 
	hearken to my prayer, which does not come from lying lips.
2 Let justice for me come forth from your presence, * 
	and let your eyes look upon that which is right.
3 You have tested and visited my heart in the night season. * 
	If you try me you shall find no wickedness in me; 
		my mouth shall not offend.
4 As for the works of others, *
	because of the words of your lips, 
         I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.
5 Hold my steps firmly in your paths, * 
	that my footsteps may not slip.
6 I have called upon you, O God, for you will hear me; * 
	incline your ear to me and hearken to my words.
7 Show your marvelous loving-kindness, you that are the Savior of those who put their trust in you *
	from the ones who resist your right hand.
8 Keep me as the apple of your eye; *
	hide me under the shadow of your wings,
9 From the ungodly who assault me, *
	even from my enemies who encompass me 
         to take away my soul.
10 They have closed their heart to pity, * 
	and their mouth speaks proud things.
11 They lie waiting in my way on every side, *
	watching how they may cast me down to the ground,
12 Like a lion that is greedy for its prey, *
	and like a young lion lurking in secret places.
13 Rise up, O Lord, confront them and cast them down; * 
	deliver my soul from the ungodly by your sword 
		and by your hand,
14 From those, O Lord, from those whose portion in life 
    is of the world, *
		whose bellies you fill with your hidden treasure.
15 They have children at their desire, *
	and leave the rest of their abundance for their little ones.
16 But as for me, I will behold your presence in righteousness; * 
	and when I awake and see your likeness, I shall be satisfied.


Psalm 18
1 I will love you, O Lord my strength; *
	the Lord is my rock, my stronghold, and my deliverer,
2 My Savior, my God, and my might, in whom I will trust, * 
	my buckler, the horn of my salvation, and my refuge.
3 I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised; * 
	so shall I be safe from my enemies.
4 The waves of death encompassed me; *
	the floods that would swallow me up made me afraid.
5 The cords of the grave surrounded me; * 
	the snares of death overtook me.
6 In my trouble I called upon the Lord * 
	and cried unto my God for help.
7 From his holy temple he heard my voice. *
	My complaint came before him; it entered into his ears.
8 The earth trembled and quaked; *
	the very foundations of the hills shook 
         and were removed, because he was angry.
9 There went out smoke from his nostrils 
    and a consuming fire out of his mouth; *
		coals of fire issued from his presence.
10 He parted the heavens also and came down, * 
	and it was dark under his feet.
11 He rode upon the cherubim and flew; *
	he came flying upon the wings of the wind.
12 He made darkness his secret place; *
	dark waters and thick clouds 
         were his covering round about him.
13 At the brightness of his presence his clouds broke forth: * 
	hailstones and coals of fire.
14 The Lord also thundered out of heaven, 
    and the Most High gave forth his voice: *
		hailstones, and coals of fire.
15 He sent out his arrows and scattered them; * 
	he cast forth lightning and destroyed them.
16 The springs of water were seen, 
    and the foundations of the world were uncovered, *
		at your rebuke, O Lord, at the blasting of the breath of your displeasure.
17 He reached down from on high to grasp me, * 
	and he took me out of many waters.
18 He delivered me from my strongest enemy, 
    and from those who hated me, *
		for they were too mighty for me.
19 They confronted me in the day of my trouble, * 
	but the Lord upheld me.
20 He brought me forth into a place of liberty; *
	he delivered me, because I had found favor in his eyes.
21 The Lord rewarded me according to my righteous dealing; * 
	according to the cleanness of my hands he recompensed me,
22 Because I had kept the ways of the Lord *
	and had not forsaken my God, as the wicked do.
23 For I had an eye unto all his laws *
	and did not cast out his commandments from me.
24 I was also uncorrupt before him *
	and kept myself from my own wickedness.
25 Therefore the Lord rewarded me 
    according to my righteous dealing, *
		and according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.
26 With the faithful you show yourself faithful, *
	and with the upright you show yourself upright.
27 With the pure you show yourself pure, *
	but with the crooked you show yourself shrewd.
28 For you shall save the people who are in adversity, * 
	but shall bring down the high looks of the proud.
29 You also shall light my lamp; *
	the Lord my God shall turn my darkness into light.
30 For with you I shall crush a host of men, *
	and with the help of my God I can leap over a wall.
31 The way of God is an undefiled way; 
    the word of the Lord also is tried in the fire; *
		he is the defender of all those who put their trust in him.
32 For who is God, but the Lord, *
	or who is a rock, except our God?
33 It is God who girds me with strength for war * 
	and makes my way perfect.
34 He makes my feet like the feet of a deer * 
	and sets me up on high.
35 He teaches my hands to fight, *
	and my arms shall bend even a bow of bronze.
36 You have given me the shield of your salvation; *
	your right hand also shall hold me up, 
         and your loving correction shall make me great.
37 You have made a broad path for my feet, * 
	and my footsteps shall not slip.
38 I will follow my enemies and overtake them; *
	I will not turn again until I have destroyed them.
39 I will smite them, and they shall not be able to stand. * 
	They shall fall under my feet.
40 You have girded me with strength for the battle; * 
	you shall throw down my enemies under me.
41 You have made my enemies turn their backs upon me, * 
	and I shall destroy those who hate me.
42 They shall cry, but there shall be none to help them; * 
	even unto the Lord shall they cry, but he shall not hear them.
43 I will beat them as small as dust before the wind; * 
	I will tread them down as mire in the streets.
44 You shall deliver me from the strivings of the peoples, * 
	and you shall make me the head of the nations.
45 A people whom I have not known * 
	shall be in subjection under me.
46 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me; * 
	and foreigners shall cringe before me.
47 Foreigners shall lose heart, *
	and being afraid shall come out of their strongholds.
48 The Lord lives, and blessed be my rock, * 
	and praised be the God of my salvation,
49 Even the God who sees that I am avenged * 
	and subdues the peoples under me.
50 It is he who delivers me from my cruel enemies, 
    and lifts me up above my adversaries; *
		you shall rid me of the wicked.
51 For this cause will I give thanks unto you, 
    O Lord, among the nations, *
		and sing praises unto your Name.
52 Great prosperity he gives unto his King, *
	and shows loving-kindness to David his Anointed, 
         and unto his seed for evermore.


Psalm 19
1 The heavens declare the glory of God, * 
	and the firmament shows his handiwork.
2 One day speaks to another, *
	and one night gives knowledge to another.
3 There is neither speech nor language, * 
	and their voices are not heard;
4 But their sound has gone out into all lands, * 
	and their words to the ends of the world.
5 In them he has set a tent for the sun; *
	which comes forth as a bridegroom out of his chamber, 
         and rejoices like a strong man to run his course.
6 It goes forth from the uttermost part of the heavens, 
    and runs about to the end of it again; *
		and there is nothing hidden from its heat.
7 The law of the Lord is perfect, reviving the soul; *
	the testimony of the Lord is sure, 
         and gives wisdom to the simple.
8 The statutes of the Lord are right, and rejoice the heart; * 
	the commandment of the Lord is pure, 
         and gives light to the eyes.
9 The fear of the Lord is clean, and endures for ever; * 
	the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.
10 More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; * 
	sweeter also than honey, 
         than the drippings from the honeycomb.
11 Moreover, by them is your servant taught, * 
	and in keeping them there is great reward.
12 Who can tell how often he offends? * 
	O cleanse me from my secret faults.
13 Keep your servant also from presumptuous sins, 
    lest they get the dominion over me; *
		so shall I be undefiled, and innocent of great offense.
14 Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart 
    be always acceptable in your sight, *
		O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.

Psalm 20
1 May the Lord hear you in the day of trouble; * 
	the Name of the God of Jacob defend you;
2 Send you help from the sanctuary, * 
	and strengthen you out of Zion;
3 Remember all your offerings, * 
	and accept your burnt sacrifice;
4 Grant you your heart’s desire, * 
	and accomplish all your plans.
5 We will rejoice in your salvation, 
    and triumph in the Name of the Lord our God; *
		may the Lord grant all your petitions.
6 Now I know that the Lord helps his Anointed, 
    and will answer him from his holy heaven, *
		even with the saving strength of his right hand.
7 Some put their trust in chariots, and some in horses, *
	but we put our trust in the Name of the Lord our God.
8 They are brought down and fallen, * 
	but we will arise and stand upright.
9 O Lord, save the King, *
	and hear us when we call upon you.


Psalm 21
1 The King shall rejoice in your strength, O Lord; * 
	exceedingly glad shall he be of your salvation.
2 You have given him his heart’s desire *
	and have not denied him the request of his lips.
3 For you shall meet him with the blessings of goodness, * 
	and shall set a crown of pure gold upon his head.
4 He asked you for life, and you gave it to him: * 
	length of days, for ever and ever.
5 His honor is great because of your salvation; * 
	glory and majesty shall you lay upon him.
6 For you shall give him everlasting felicity *
	and make him glad with the joy of your countenance.
7 For the King puts his trust in the Lord, *
	and because of the mercy of the Most High, 
         he shall not be moved.
8 All your enemies shall feel your hand; *
	your right hand shall find those who hate you.
9 You shall make them like a fiery oven in the time of your wrath; *
	the Lord shall destroy them in his displeasure, 
         and the fire shall consume them.
10 Their offspring you shall root out of the earth * 
	and their seed from among the children of men.
11 For they intended evil against you *
	and imagined wicked schemes, 
         which they are not able to perform.
12 Therefore you shall put them to flight, *
	and the strings of your bow you shall aim at their faces.
13 Be exalted, O Lord, in your own strength; * 
	so we will sing and praise your power.


Psalm 22
1 My God, my God, why have you forsaken me, * 
	and are so far from my cry, 
         and from the words of my complaint?
2 O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you do not hear; * 
	in the night season also, but I find no rest.
3 But you remain holy, *
	enthroned upon the praises of Israel.
4 Our fathers hoped in you; *
	they trusted in you, and you delivered them.
5 They called upon you, and were delivered; *
	they put their trust in you, and were not confounded.
6 But as for me, I am a worm, and no man, * 
	scorned by all, and the outcast of the people.
7 All those who see me laugh me to scorn; *
	they curl their lips, and shake their heads, saying,
8 “He trusted in God, that he would deliver him; * 
	let him deliver him, if he will have him.”
9 But you are he that took me out of my mother’s womb; * 
	you were my hope, when I was yet upon my mother’s breasts.
10 I have been cast upon you ever since I was born; * 
	you are my God, even from my mother’s womb.
11 O go not far from me, for trouble is near at hand, * 
	and there is none to help me.
12 Many oxen have come around me; *
	fat bulls of Bashan close me in on every side.
13 They gape at me with their mouths, * 
	like a ravening and a roaring lion.
14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; * 
	my heart also in the midst of my body is like melting wax.
15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd, 
    and my tongue cleaves to my gums; *
		and you bring me into the dust of death.
16 For many dogs have come about me, *
	and the council of the wicked lays siege against me.
17 They pierced my hands and my feet; I can count all my bones; *
	they stand staring and looking upon me.
18 They part my garments among them, * 
	and casts lots for my clothing.
19 But be not far from me, O Lord. *
	You are my succour; hasten to help me.
20 Deliver my soul from the sword, * 
	my life from the power of the dog.
21 Save me from the lion’s mouth, *
	and my soul in misery from among the horns of wild oxen.
22 I will declare your Name to my brethren; *
	in the midst of the congregation I will praise you.
23 O praise the Lord, you that fear him; *
	magnify him, all you seed of Jacob, 
         and fear him, all you seed of Israel.
24 For he has not despised nor abhorred 
    the low estate of the poor; *
		he has not hidden his face from him, 
         but when he called unto him, he heard him.
25 My praise is of you in the great congregation; *
	my vows will I perform in the sight of those who fear him.
26 The poor shall eat and be satisfied; *
	those who seek after the Lord shall praise him; 
         may your hearts live for ever.
27 All the ends of the world shall remember, 
    and be turned unto the Lord, *
		and all the families of the nations shall worship before him.
28  For the kingdom is the Lord’s, *
	and he is the Governor among the peoples.
29 All those who sleep in the earth, how shall they worship him?* 
	All those who go down into the dust, 
		how shall they kneel before him?
30 But my life shall be preserved in his sight, 
    and my children shall worship him; *
		they shall tell of the Lord to the generations to come;
31 And to a people yet unborn shall they declare his righteousness, *
	that he hath brought it to pass.


Psalm 23
1 The Lord is my shepherd; * 
	therefore I can lack nothing.
2 He shall feed me in green pastures *
	and lead me forth beside the waters of comfort.
3 He shall refresh my soul * 
	and bring me forth in the paths of righteousness 
         for his Name’s sake.
4 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow 
    of death, I will fear no evil; * 
		for you are with me;
         your rod and your staff comfort me.
5 You shall prepare a table before me, 
    in the presence of those who trouble me; * 
		you have anointed my head with oil, 
         and my cup shall be full.
6 Surely your goodness and mercy 
    shall follow me all the days of my life, *
		and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.

Psalm 24
1 The earth is the Lord’s and all that is in it, *
	the compass of the world and those who dwell therein.
2 For he has founded it upon the seas *
	and established it upon the rivers of the deep.
3 Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord? * 
	Or who shall stand in his holy place?
4 He who has clean hands and a pure heart, *
	and who has not set his mind upon vanity, 
         nor sworn to deceive his neighbor.
5 He shall receive blessing from the Lord *
	and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
6 This is the generation of those who seek him, *
	even of those who seek your face, O God of Jacob.
7 Lift up your heads, O you gates, and be lifted up, you everlasting doors; *
	and the King of glory shall come in.
8 “Who is the King of glory?” *
	“It is the Lord strong and mighty, even the Lord, 
		mighty in battle.”
9 Lift up your heads, O you gates, and be lifted up, 
    you everlasting doors; *
		and the King of glory shall come in.
10 “Who is the King of glory?” *
	“The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory.”


Psalm 25
1 Unto you, O Lord, will I lift up my soul; 
    my God, I have put my trust in you; *
		O let me not be ashamed, 
         neither let my enemies triumph over me.
2 For all those who hope in you shall not be ashamed, * 
	but those who deal untruly shall be put to confusion.
3 Show me your ways, O Lord, * 
	and teach me your paths.
4 Lead me forth in your truth, and teach me, *
	for you are the God of my salvation; 
		in you has been my hope all the day long.
5 Call to remembrance, O Lord, your tender mercies, *
	and your loving-kindnesses, which have been from of old.
6 O remember not the sins and offenses of my youth, *
	but according to your mercy think on me, O Lord, 
         in your goodness.
7 Gracious and righteous is the Lord; * 
	therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
8 Those who are meek shall he guide in judgment, * 
	and those who are gentle shall he teach his way. 
9 All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth *
	to those who keep his covenant and his testimonies.
10 For your Name’s sake, O Lord, * 
	forgive my sin, for it is great.
11 Who is the one who fears the Lord? *
	He shall teach him in the way that he shall choose.
12 He shall dwell at ease, *
	and his seed shall inherit the land.
13 The Lord reveals his secret counsel to those who fear him, *
	and he will show them his covenant.
14 My eyes are ever looking to the Lord, * 
	for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.
15 Turn to me, and have mercy on me, * 
	for I am desolate and in misery.
16 The sorrows of my heart are enlarged; * 
	O bring me out of my troubles.
17 Look upon my adversity and misery * 
	and forgive me all my sin.
18 Consider my enemies, how many they are, *
	and how they bear a tyrannous hate against me.
19 O keep my soul and deliver me; *
	let me not be ashamed, for I have put my trust in you.
20 Let integrity and righteous dealing preserve me, * 
	for my hope has been in you.
21 Deliver Israel, O God, * 
	out of all his troubles.

Psalm 26
1 Be my judge, O Lord, for I have walked innocently; *
	my trust has been in the Lord; therefore I shall not fall.
2 Test me, O Lord, and prove me; * 
	examine my heart and my mind.
3 For your loving-kindness is ever before my eyes, * 
	and I will walk in your truth.
4 I have not dwelt with evildoers, *
	neither will I have fellowship with the deceitful.
5 I have hated the company of the wicked, * 
	and will not sit among the ungodly.
6 I will wash my hands in innocence, O Lord, * 
	and so will I go to your altar,
7 That I may lift up the voice of thanksgiving * 
	and tell of all your wondrous works.
8 Lord, I have loved the habitation of your house * 
	and the place where your honor dwells.
9 O take not away my soul with the sinners, * 
	nor my life with the bloodthirsty,
10 Whose hands are full of wickedness, * 
	and their right hand full of bribes.
11 But as for me, I will walk innocently; *
	O deliver me, and be merciful unto me.
12 My foot stands firm; *
	I will praise the Lord in the congregations.

Psalm 27
1 The Lord is my light and my salvation; 
    whom then shall I fear? *
		The Lord is the strength of my life; 
         of whom then shall I be afraid?
2 When the wicked, even my enemies and my foes, 
    came upon me to eat up my flesh, *
		they stumbled and fell.
3 Though a host were encamped against me, 
    yet my heart would not be afraid, *
		and though war rose up against me, 
         yet would I put my trust in him.
4 One thing have I desired of the Lord; one thing I seek: * 
	that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,
5 To behold the fair beauty of the Lord, * 
	and to seek him in his temple.
6 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his tabernacle; * 
	indeed, in the secret place of his dwelling he shall hide me, 
         and set me high upon a rock of stone.
7 And now he shall lift up my head * 
	above my enemies round about me.
8 Therefore I will offer in his dwelling 
    an oblation with great gladness; *
		I will sing and speak praises unto the Lord.
9 Hearken to my voice, O Lord, when I cry unto you; * 
	have mercy upon me and hear me.
10 You speak to my heart and say, “Seek my face.” * 
	Your face, O Lord, will I seek.
11 O hide not your face from me, *
	nor cast your servant away in displeasure.
12 You have been my helper; *
	leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.
13 When my father and my mother forsake me, * 
	the Lord takes me in.
14 Teach me your way, O Lord, *
	and lead me in the right way, because of my enemies.
15 Deliver me not over to the will of my adversaries, *
	for there are false witnesses who have risen up against me, 
         and those who speak wrong.
16 I would utterly have fainted, *
	had I not believed that I would see 
         the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.

Psalm 28
1 Unto you will I cry, O Lord my rock; do not be deaf to my prayer; *
    lest, if you do not answer, 
		I become like those who go down into the pit.
2 Hear the voice of my humble petitions when I cry unto you, * 
	when I hold up my hands 
         toward the sanctuary of your holy temple.
3 O cast me not away, 
    neither destroy me with the ungodly and evildoers, *
		who speak as friends to their neighbors, 
         but imagine evil in their hearts.
4 Reward them according to their deeds *
	and according to the wickedness of their own inventions.
5 Recompense them according to the work of their hands; * 
	pay them what they have deserved.
6 For they regard not in their mind the works of the Lord, 
    nor the operation of his hands; *
		therefore he shall break them down and not build them up.
7 Praised be the Lord, *
	for he has heard the voice of my humble petitions.
8 The Lord is my strength and my shield; 
    my heart has trusted in him, and I am helped; *
		therefore my heart dances for joy, 
         and in my song will I praise him.
9 The Lord is my strength, *
	and he is the sure defense of his Anointed.
10 O save your people, and give your blessing to your inheritance;* 
	feed them, and lift them up for ever.

Psalm 29
1 Ascribe unto the Lord, O you mighty, * 
	ascribe unto the Lord worship and strength.
2 Give the Lord the honor due unto his Name; * 
	worship the Lord with holy worship.
3 It is the Lord that commands the waters; *
	it is the glorious God that makes the thunder.
4 It is the Lord that rules the sea; 
    the voice of the Lord is mighty in its working; *
		the voice of the Lord is a glorious voice.
5 The voice of the Lord breaks the cedar trees; * 
	indeed, the Lord breaks the cedars of Lebanon. 
6 He makes them also to skip like a calf, * 
	Lebanon also, and Sirion, like a young ox.
7 The voice of the Lord divides the flames of fire; 
    the voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness; *
		indeed, the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.
8 The voice of the Lord makes the deer to bring forth young, 
    and strips the forests bare; *
		in his temple all cry “Glory.”
9 The Lord sits above the floodwaters, * 
	and the Lord remains King for ever.
10 The Lord shall give strength to his people; *
	the Lord shall give his people the blessing of peace.

Psalm 30
1 I will magnify you, O Lord, for you have lifted me up, * 
	and have not let my foes triumph over me.
2 O Lord my God, I cried unto you, * 
	and you have made me whole.
3 You, Lord, have brought my soul out of the Grave; *
	you have saved my life from among those 
         who go down to the Pit.
4 Sing praises unto the Lord, O you saints of his; * 
	and give thanks unto him for the remembrance of his holiness.
5 For his wrath endures but the twinkling of an eye, 
    his pleasure for a lifetime; *
		heaviness may endure for a night, 
         but joy comes in the morning.
6 In my prosperity I said, “I shall never be moved; *
	you, Lord, of your goodness, have made my hill so strong.”
7 You turned your face from me, * 
	and I was distressed.
8 Then I cried unto you, O Lord, *
	and came to my Lord most humbly.
9 What profit is there in my bloodshed, * 
	if I go down into the Pit?
10 Shall the dust give thanks unto you? * 
	Or shall it declare your faithfulness?
11 Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me. * 
	O Lord, be my helper.
12 You have turned my lamentation into dancing; *
	you have put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness.
13 Therefore shall my heart sing of your praise without ceasing. * 
	O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto you for ever.


Psalm 31
1 In you, O Lord, have I put my trust; *
	let me never be put to confusion; 
         deliver me in your righteousness.
2 Bow down your ear to me; * 
	make haste to deliver me;
3 And be my strong rock and house of defense, * 
	that you may save me.
4 For you are my strong rock and my castle; *
	be also my guide, and lead me for your Name’s sake.
5 Draw me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me, * 
	for you are my strength.
6 Into your hands I commend my spirit, *
	for you have redeemed me, O Lord, O God of truth.
7 I have hated those who hold to worthless vanities, * 
	and my trust has been in the Lord.
8 I will be glad and rejoice in your mercy, *
	for you have considered my trouble, 
         and have known my soul in adversities.
9 You have not shut me up in the hand of the enemy * 
	but have set my feet where they may walk at liberty.
10 Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble; * 
	my eye is consumed with heaviness, 
         and also my soul and my body.
11 For my life has grown old with heaviness, * 
	and my years with mourning.
12 My strength fails me because of my iniquity, * 
	and my bones are consumed.
13 I have become a reproof among all my enemies, 
    but especially among my neighbors; *
		my acquaintances are afraid of me, 
         and those who see me in the street shrink from me.
14 I am utterly forgotten, as a dead man, out of mind; * 
	I have become like a broken vessel.
15 For I have heard the whispering of the multitude, 
    and fear is on every side, *
		while they conspire together against me 
         and take their counsel to take away my life.
16 But my hope has been in you, O Lord; * 
	I have said, “You are my God.”
17 My time is in your hand; *
	deliver me from the hand of my enemies, 
         and from those who persecute me.
18 Show your servant the light of your countenance, * 
	and save me for your mercy’s sake.
19 Let me not be confounded, O Lord, for I have called upon you; *
	let the ungodly be put to confusion, 
         and be put to silence in the grave.
20 Let the lying lips be put to silence, *
	which cruelly, disdainfully, 
         and despitefully speak against the righteous.
21 Oh, how plentiful is your goodness, 
    which you have laid up for those who fear you, *
		and which you have prepared 
         for those who put their trust in you, 
              even before the children of men!
22 You hide them in the secret place of your presence 
    from those who conspire against them; *
		you keep them in your refuge from the strife of tongues.
23 Thanks be to the Lord, *
	for he has shown me marvellously 
         great kindness in a strong city.
24 But when I was afraid, I said in my haste, * 
	“I am cast out of the sight of your eyes.”
25 Nevertheless, you heard the voice of my prayer * 
	when I cried unto you.
26  O love the Lord, all you his saints, *
	for the Lord preserves those who are faithful, 
         and plenteously repays the proud.
27 Be strong, and he shall establish your heart, * 
	all you that put your trust in the Lord.

Psalm 32
1 Blessed is the one whose unrighteousness is forgiven, *
	and whose sin is covered.
2 Blessed is the one to whom the Lord imputes no sin, * 
	and in whose spirit there is no guile.
3 For while I held my tongue, my bones wasted away; *
	I ceased not from groaning all the day long.
4 For your hand was heavy upon me day and night, *
	and I was dried up and withered, as in the drought of summer.
5 Then I acknowledged my sin unto you, * 
	and I did not hide my iniquity.
6 I said, I will confess my sins unto the Lord; * 
	and so you forgave the wickedness of my sin.
7 For this reason shall all the godly make their prayers unto you at a time when you may be found; *
	when the great floodwaters rise, they shall not reach them.
8 You are my hiding-place; 
    you shall preserve me from trouble; * 
		you shall encompass me with songs of deliverance.
9 “I will instruct you and teach you in the way that you should go,* 
	and I will guide you with my eye.
10 “Do not be like the horse and mule, 
    which have no understanding, *
		whose mouths must be held with bit and bridle, 
         or else they will not come near you.”
11 Great troubles remain for the ungodly; *
	but mercy embraces those who trust in the Lord.
12 Be glad, O you righteous, and rejoice in the Lord; * 
	and be joyful, all who are true of heart.

Psalm 33
1 Rejoice in the Lord, O you righteous; * 
	it is fitting for the just to be thankful.
2 Praise the Lord with the harp; *
	sing praises unto him with the ten-stringed lute.
3 Sing unto him a new song; *
	make skillful melody and cry aloud with joy.
4 For the word of the Lord is true, * 
	and all his works are faithful.
5  He loves righteousness and true judgment; * 
	the earth is full of the goodness of the Lord.
6 By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, * 
	and all the hosts of them by the breath of his mouth.
7 He gathers the waters of the sea together, as in a heap, * 
	and lays up the deep, as in a treasure house.
8 Let all the earth fear the Lord; *
	stand in awe of him, all you that dwell in the world.
9 For he spoke, and it was done; *
	he commanded and it stood fast.
10 The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to naught; * 
	he makes the devices of the peoples to be of no effect, 
         and casts out the counsels of princes.
11 The counsel of the Lord shall endure for ever, *
	and the thoughts of his heart from generation to generation.
12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, *
	and blessed are the people he has chosen for himself to be his inheritance.
13 The Lord looks down from heaven 
    and beholds all the children of men; *
		from the habitation of his dwelling 
         he considers all those who dwell on the earth.
14 He fashions all the hearts of them * 
	and understands all their works.
15 There is no king who can be saved by a mighty host; * 
	neither is any mighty man delivered by great strength.
16 A horse is considered a vain hope to save a man; * 
	neither shall it deliver anyone by its great strength.
17 Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon those who fear him, * 
	and upon those who put their trust in his mercy,
18 To deliver their soul from death, *
	and to feed them in the time of famine.
19 Our soul has patiently waited for the Lord, * 
	for he is our help and our shield.
20 Our heart shall rejoice in him, *
	because we have hoped in his holy Name.
21 Let your merciful kindness, O Lord, be upon us, * 
	as we have put our trust in you.

Psalm 34
1 I will always give thanks unto the Lord; * 
	his praise shall ever be in my mouth.
2 My soul shall make its boast in the Lord; * 
	the humble shall hear this and be glad.
3 O praise the Lord with me, *
	and let us magnify his Name together.
4 I sought the Lord, and he heard me; * 
	he delivered me out of all my fears.
5 They looked unto him, and were made glad, * 
	and their faces were not ashamed.
6 Look, the poor man cries, and the Lord hears him, * 
	and saves him out of all his troubles.
7 The angel of the Lord camps round about those who fear him, *
	and delivers them in time of need.
8 O taste and see how gracious the Lord is; * 
	blessed is the one who trusts in him.
9 O fear the Lord, you that are his saints; * 
	for those who fear him lack nothing.
10 The lions lack and suffer hunger, *
	but those who seek the Lord shall lack nothing that is good.
11 Come, children, and listen to me; *
	I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
12 Who among you desires to live, * 
	and longs to see good days?
13 Keep your tongue from evil, *
	and your lips from speaking lies.
14 Turn from evil and do good; * 
	seek peace and pursue it.
15 The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, * 
	and his ears are open to their prayers.
16 The countenance of the Lord is against those who do evil, * 
	to root out the remembrance of them from the earth.
17 The righteous cry, and the Lord hears them * 
	and delivers them out of all their troubles.
18 The Lord is near to those who are brokenhearted * 
	and will save those who are crushed in spirit.
19 Great are the troubles of the righteous, *
	but the Lord delivers him out of them all.
20 He keeps all his bones, *
	so that not one of them is broken.
21 But evil shall slay the ungodly, *
	and those who hate the righteous shall be desolate.
22 The Lord delivers the souls of his servants, *
	and all those who put their trust in him shall not be destitute.

Psalm 35
1 Contend, O Lord, with those who contend with me, * 
	and fight against those who fight against me.
2 Take up the shield and buckler, * 
	and stand up to help me.
3 Bring forth the spear and bar the way 
    against those who pursue me; *
		say to my soul, “I am your salvation.”
4 Let them be confounded and put to shame 
    who seek after my life; *
		let them be turned back and brought to confusion 
         who imagine evil against me.
5 Let them be as the chaff before the wind, * 
	and let the angel of the Lord scatter them.
6 Let their way be dark and slippery, *
	and let the angel of the Lord pursue them.
7 For they have secretly laid their net 
    to destroy me without a cause; *
		indeed, without a cause have they made a pit 
         to take away my life.
8 Let sudden destruction come upon them unawares, and the net, 
    which they have laid secretly, catch themselves, *
		that they may fall into their own trouble.
9 Then shall my soul be joyful in the Lord; * 
	I shall rejoice in his salvation.
10 All my bones shall say, “Lord, who is like you? 
   You deliver the poor from those who are too strong for them; *
		indeed, the poor and those who are in misery 
         from those who rob them.”
11 Malicious witnesses rise up; *
	they charge me with matters I know nothing about.
12 They repay me evil for good, *
	to the great sorrow of my soul.
13 Nevertheless, when they were sick, I put on sackcloth and humbled myself with fasting; *
	I prayed with my whole heart, 
         as if it had been my friend or my brother.
14 I behaved myself as one who mourns for his mother; * 
	I was bowed down with heaviness of heart.
15 But in my adversity, they rejoiced 
    and gathered themselves together; *
		indeed, those who struck me came together against me 
         and I had no rest; they tore at me, and would not cease.
16 When I stumbled they mocked me exceedingly, * 
	and gnashed at me with their teeth.
17 Lord, how long will you look on this? *
	O deliver me from the calamities they bring upon me, 
         and my life from the lions.
18 So will I give you thanks in the great congregation; * 
	I will praise you among many people.
19 O let not those who are my enemies triumph over me deceitfully; *
	neither let them wink with their eyes, 
         those who hate me without a cause.
20 For their talking is not for peace; *
	but they imagine deceitful words against those 
         who are quiet in the land.
21 They open their mouths at me, and say, * 
	“Aha! Aha! We saw it with our own eyes!”
22 This you have seen, O Lord. *
	Hold not your tongue then; be not far from me, O Lord.
23 Awake, and stand up to judge my case; * 
	avenge my cause, my God and my Lord.
24 Judge me, O Lord my God, according to your righteousness, * 
	and let them not triumph over me.
25 Let them not say in their hearts, “Aha! We have what we want!” *
	Neither let them say, “We have devoured him.”
26 Let them be put to confusion and shame 
    who rejoice at my trouble; *
		let them be clothed with shame and dishonor 
         who boast against me.
27 Let them be glad and rejoice who favor my righteous cause; * 
	indeed, let them say always, “Great is the Lord, 
         who takes pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.”
28 And as for my tongue, it shall be talking of your righteousness * 
	and of your praise all the day long.

Psalm 36
1 My heart shows me the wickedness of the ungodly; * 
	there is no fear of God before his eyes.
2 For he flatters himself in his own sight, * 
	until his abominable sin is found out.
3 The words of his mouth are unrighteous and full of deceit; * 
	he has left off behaving wisely and doing good.
4 He imagines mischief upon his bed, 
    and has set himself in no good way; *
		neither does he abhor anything that is evil.
5 Your mercy, O Lord, reaches to the heavens, * 
	and your faithfulness to the clouds.
6 Your righteousness stands like the strong mountains; 
    your judgments are like the great deep: *
		you, Lord, shall save both man and beast.
7 How excellent is your mercy, O God! *
	The children of men shall take refuge 
         under the shadow of your wings.
8 They shall be satisfied with the plenteousness of your house; * 
	and you shall give them drink from your pleasures 
         as out of a river.
9 For with you is the well of life; *
	and in your light shall we see light.
10 O continue your loving-kindness to those who know you, * 
	and your righteousness to those who are true of heart.
11 O let not the foot of the proud come against me, * 
	and let not the hand of the ungodly cast me down.
12 There have they fallen, all those who work wickedness; * 
	they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.

Psalm 37
1 Fret not yourself because of the ungodly, * 
	neither be envious of those who are evildoers.
2 For they shall soon be dried up like the grass, * 
	and be withered even as the green herb.
3 Put your trust in the Lord, and do good; * 
	dwell in the land, and surely you shall be fed.
4 Delight yourself in the Lord, *
	and he shall give you your heart’s desire.
5 Commit your way unto the Lord and put your trust in him, * 
	and he shall bring it to pass.
6 He shall make your righteousness as clear as the light * 
	and your just dealing as the noonday.
7 Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him; *
	do not grieve yourself over the one whose way prospers, 
         over the one who carries out evil counsels.
8 Refrain from wrath, and let go of anger; *
	fret not yourself, lest you be moved to do evil.
9 For evildoers shall be rooted out, *
	but those who wait patiently for the Lord, 
         they shall inherit the land.
10 Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone; * 
	you shall look for their place, and they shall not be there.
11 But the meek-spirited shall possess the land *
	and shall be refreshed with an abundance of peace.
12 The ungodly plot against the just * 
	and gnash at them with their teeth.
13 The Lord shall laugh at them in scorn, * 
	for he sees that their day is coming.
14 The ungodly have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow *
	to cast down the poor and needy, 
         and to slay those who walk aright.
15 Their sword shall go through their own heart, * 
	and their bow shall be broken.
16 The little that the righteous has *
	is better than great riches of the ungodly.
17 For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken, * 
	but the Lord upholds the righteous. 
18 The Lord knows the days of the godly, *  
	and their inheritance shall endure for ever.
19 They shall not be confounded in perilous times, * 
	and in the days of famine they shall have enough.
20 As for the ungodly, they shall perish, and the enemies 
    of the Lord shall be consumed as in a fiery furnace; *
		even as smoke shall they vanish away.
21 The ungodly borrow and do not repay, *
	but the righteous are merciful and generous.
22 Those who are blessed by God shall possess the land, * 
	but those who are cursed by him shall be rooted out.
23 The Lord orders a man’s steps; *
	he makes his footsteps sure and preserves him on his path.

Psalm 38
1 Rebuke me not, O Lord, in your anger, *
	neither chasten me in your weighty displeasure.
2 For your arrows stick fast in me, * 
	and your hand presses me hard.
3 There is no health in my flesh, because of your displeasure; * 
	neither is there any rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.
4 For my iniquities have gone over my head 
	and are like a heavy burden, too much for me to bear.
5 My wounds stink and fester * 
	by reason of my foolishness.
6 I am brought into such great trouble and misery * 
	that I go about mourning all the day long.
7 For my loins are filled with burning, * 
	and there is no wholeness in my body.
8 I am feeble and sorely smitten; *
	I have roared because of the tumult of my heart.
9 Lord, you know all my desire, *
	and my groaning is not hidden from you.
10 My heart is panting, my strength has failed me, * 
	and the sight of my eyes is gone from me.
11 My friends and my neighbors turn away from my trouble, * 
	and my kinsmen stand afar off.
12 Those also who seek after my life lay snares for me, *
	and those who go about to do me evil talk of wickedness 
		and imagine deceit all the day long.
13 As for me, I am like the deaf who do not hear, *
	and as one who is mute, who does not open his mouth.
14 I have become like a man who hears not, * 
	and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
15 For in you, O Lord, have I put my trust; * 
	you shall answer for me, O Lord my God.
16 I have said, “Let not my enemies triumph over me,” *
	for when my foot slipped, they rejoiced greatly over me.
17 Truly, I am about to fall, *
	and my pain is ever with me.
18 For I will confess my wickedness, * 
	and be sorry for my sin.
19 But my enemies live, and are mighty, *
	and those who hate me wrongfully are many in number.
20 Those also who repay evil for good are against me, * 
	because I follow that which is good.
21 Forsake me not, O Lord my God; * 
	O be not far from me.
22 Make haste to help me, *
	O Lord God of my salvation.

Psalm 39
1 I said, “I will take heed to my ways, * 
	that I may not offend with my tongue.
2 I will keep my mouth as with a bridle * 
	while the ungodly are in my sight.”
3 I held my tongue and spoke nothing; *
	I kept silence, even from good words; but it was pain and grief to me.
4 My heart was hot within me, and while I was thus pondering the fire kindled, *
	and at the last I spoke with my tongue:
5 “Lord, let me know my end and the number of my days, * 
	that I may learn how short my life is.
6 Behold, you have made my days as a span in length, * 
	and my age is even as nothing before you; and truly everyone living is but a breath.
7 For everyone walks about as a shadow, and disquiets himself in vain; *
	he heaps up riches and cannot tell who shall gather them.
8 And now, Lord, what is my hope? * 
	Truly, my hope is in you.
9 Deliver me from all my offences, *
	and make me not a taunt of the foolish.
10 I became mute and opened not my mouth, * 
	for it was you that brought it to pass.
11 Take your affliction from me; *
	I am consumed by the blows of your heavy hand.
12 When you, with rebukes, chasten someone for sin, you consume what is dear to him, like a moth eating a garment; *
	everyone therefore is but vanity.
13 Hear my prayer, O Lord, and with your ears consider my cry; * 
	hold not your peace at my tears.
14 For I am a stranger with you, *
	and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
15 O turn your gaze from me, that I may again be glad, * 
	before I go away to be seen no more.”

Psalm 40
1 I waited patiently for the Lord, *
	and he inclined to me, and heard my call.
2 He brought me out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and clay; *
	he set my feet upon the rock, and secured my footing.
3 He has put a new song in my mouth, *  
	a song of thanksgiving unto our God.
4 Many shall see and fear, *
	and shall put their trust in the Lord.
5 Blessed is the man who has set his hope in the Lord, * 
	and has not turned to the proud, or to those who go about lying.
6 O Lord my God, great are the wondrous works 
    which you have done, and also your thoughts toward us; *
		there is none who can be compared with you.
7 If I should declare them and speak of them, * 
	they would be more than I am able to express.
8 Sacrifice and offering you do not desire, * 
	but my ears you have opened.
9 Burnt offerings and sin offerings you have not required; * 
	and so I said, “Behold, I come”;
10 In the volume of the book it is written of me, 
    that I delight to do your will, O my God; *
		indeed, your law is within my heart.
11 I have declared your righteousness in the great congregation; * 
	behold, I will not restrain my lips, O Lord, and that you know.
12 I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart; * 
	my talk has been of your truth and of your salvation.
13 I have not concealed your loving mercy and truth * 
	from the great congregation.
14 Withdraw not your mercy from me, O Lord; *
	let your loving-kindness and your truth always preserve me.
15 For innumerable troubles have encompassed me; my sins 
    have taken such hold of me that I am not able to look up; *
		indeed, they are more in number than the hairs of my head, 
         and my heart has utterly failed me.
16 O Lord, let it be your pleasure to deliver me; * 
	make haste, O Lord, to help me.
17 Let them be ashamed and confounded 
    who seek after my soul to destroy it; *
		let them be driven backward and rebuked who wish me evil.
18 Let them be desolate and rewarded with shame * 
	who say to me, “Aha, Aha.”
19 Let all those who seek you be joyful and glad in you; *
	and let those who love your salvation say always, 
         “The Lord be praised.”
20 As for me, I am poor and needy, * 
	but the Lord cares for me.
21 You are my helper and deliverer; * 
	do not tarry, O my God.

Psalm 41
1 Blessed is the one who considers the poor and needy; * 
	the Lord shall deliver him in the time of trouble.
2 The Lord preserves him and keeps him alive, 
    that he may be blessed upon earth, *
		and delivers him not over to the will of his enemies.
3 The Lord comforts him when he lies sick upon his bed, * 
	and restores him from his bed of sickness.
4 I said, “Lord, be merciful to me; *
	heal my soul, for I have sinned against you.”
5 My enemies speak evil of me: *
	“When shall he die, and his name perish?”
6 And if anyone comes to see me, he speaks empty words; * 
	his heart conceives falsehood within him, 
         and when he goes forth, he tells it.
7 All my enemies whisper together against me; * 
	even against me are they devising evil:
8 “A deadly thing has taken hold of him, *
	and now that he lies down, he will rise up no more.”
9 Indeed, even my own familiar friend, whom I trusted, 
    who also ate of my bread, *
		has lifted up his heel against me.
10 But be merciful to me, O Lord; *
	raise me up again, and I shall repay them.
11 By this I know you favor me, *
	that my enemy does not triumph over me.
12 And when I am in health, you uphold me * 
	and shall set me before your face for ever.
13 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; * 
	world without end. Amen.

Psalm 42
1 As the deer desires the water brooks, * 
	so longs my soul for you, O God.
2 My soul is athirst for God, even for the living God; *
	when shall I come to appear before the presence of God?
3 My tears have been my food day and night, *
	while all day long they say to me, “Where now is your God?”
4 When I think upon these things, I pour out my heart; * 
	when I remember how I went with the multitude, 
         and brought them into the house of God,
5 With the voice of praise and thanksgiving * 
	among those who keep holy day.
6 Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul, * 
	and why are you so disquieted within me?
7 O put your trust in God, *
	for I will yet give him thanks, 
         who is the help of my countenance, and my God.
8 My soul is heavy within me; *
	therefore I will remember you from the land of Jordan, 
         and from Mizar among the hills of Hermon.
9 One deep calls to another in the noise of your waterfalls; * 
	all your waves and storms have gone over me.
10 The Lord will grant his loving-kindness in the daytime; * 
	and in the night season will I sing of him, 
         and make my prayer to the God of my life.
11 I will say to God my rock, “Why have you forgotten me? * 
	Why am I full of heaviness, while the enemy oppresses me?”
12 My bones are broken asunder, *
	while my enemies mock me to my face,
13 While all day long they say to me, * 
	“Where now is your God?”
14 Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul, * 
	and why are you so disquieted within me?
15 O put your trust in God, *
	for I will yet give him thanks, 
         who is the help of my countenance, and my God.

Psalm 43
1 Give judgment for me, O God, 
    and defend my cause against the ungodly people; *
		O deliver me from the deceitful and the wicked.
2 For you are the God of my strength; 
    why have you put me far from you? *
		And why do I go about with heaviness, 
         while the enemy oppresses me?
3 O send out your light and your truth, that they may lead me, * 
	and bring me to your holy hill, and to your dwelling;
4 That I may go to the altar of God, 
    even to the God of my joy and gladness; *
		and on the harp will I give thanks to you, O God, my God.
5 Why are you so full of heaviness, O my soul? * 
	and why are you so disquieted within me?
6 O put your trust in God, *
	for I will yet give him thanks, 
         who is the help of my countenance, and my God.

Psalm 44
1 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us,* 
	what you did in the days of old;
2 How you drove out the nations with your hand, 
    and planted our fathers in the land; *
		how you destroyed the nations and cast them out.
3 For they did not possess the land by their own sword, * 
	neither was it their own arm that helped them;
4 But by your right hand, and your arm, 
    and the light of your countenance, *
		because you favored them.
5 You are my King, O God; * 
	you send help to Jacob.
6 Through you we will overthrow our enemies, *
	and in your Name will we tread down those 
         who rise up against us.
7 For I will not trust in my bow; *
	it is not my sword that shall help me;
8 But you save us from our enemies * 
	and put to shame those who hate us.
9 We make our boast in God all day long * 
	and will praise your Name for ever.
10 But now you have cast us off and put us to shame, * 
	and you do not go forth with our armies.
11 You make us turn our backs upon our enemies, * 
	so that those who hate us plunder our goods.
12 You let us be eaten up like sheep *
	and have scattered us among the nations.
13 You sell your people for nothing * 
	and take no money for them.
14 You make us the reproach of our neighbors, *
	to be laughed to scorn, 
         and held in derision by those who are round about us.
15 You make us a byword among the nations, * 
	so that the peoples shake their heads at us.
16 My disgrace is daily before me, *
	and the shame of my face has covered me,
17 Because of the voice of the slanderer and blasphemer, * 
	because of the enemy and avenger.
18 And though all this has come upon us, yet we do not forget you, *
	nor have we been unfaithful to your covenant.
19 Our heart has not turned back, *
	nor have our steps departed from your way,
20 Though you have crushed us in the haunt of jackals, * 
	and covered us with the shadow of death.
21 If we have forgotten the Name of our God, 
    and held up our hands to any strange god, *
shall not God search it out? 
         For he knows the very secrets of the heart.
22 For your sake we are killed all the day long, *
	and are counted as sheep appointed to be slain.
23 Rise up, O Lord! Why are you sleeping ? * 
	Awake, and cast us not away for ever.
24 Why do you hide your face *
	and forget our misery and trouble?
25 For our soul is brought low, even to the dust; * 
	our belly cleaves to the ground.
26 Arise, O Lord, and help us, *
	and deliver us for your mercy’s sake.

Psalm 45
1 My heart overflows with a noble song; *
	I will sing my words to the King; 
         my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
2 You are fairer than the children of men; *
	full of grace are your lips, 
         because God has blessed you for ever.
3 Gird your sword upon your thigh, most mighty one, * 
	according to your honor and majesty.
4 In your majesty be victorious; ride out for the sake 
    of truth to bear witness to righteousness, *
		and your right hand shall show you marvelous things.
5 Your arrows are very sharp in the heart of the King’s enemies, * 
	and the peoples shall be subdued under you.
6 Your throne, O God, endures for ever; *
	the scepter of your kingdom is a righteous scepter.
7 You have loved righteousness and hated iniquity; * 
	therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil 
         of gladness above your fellows.
8 All your garments smell of myrrh, aloes, and cassia; *
	out of the ivory palaces, 
         stringed instruments have made you glad.
9 Kings’ daughters are among your honorable women; *
	at your right hand stands the queen in a vesture of gold,
         wrought with many colors.
10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider; incline your ear; * 
	forget your own people, and your father’s house.
11 So shall the King have pleasure in your beauty; * 
	since he is your Lord, honor him.
12 And the daughter of Tyre shall bring you gifts; *
	the rich also among the peoples shall seek your favor.
13 The King’s daughter is all glorious within the palace; * 
	her clothing is of wrought gold.
14 She shall be brought to the king in embroidered raiment; * 
	the virgins who are her companions shall bring her to you.
15 With joy and gladness shall they bring her, * 
	and shall enter into the King’s palace.
16 Instead of your fathers, you shall have sons, * 
	whom you shall make princes in all the land.
17 I will make your Name to be remembered 
    from one generation to another; *
therefore, the peoples shall praise you, world without end.

Psalm 46
1 God is our refuge and strength, * 
	a very present help in trouble.
2 Therefore we will not fear, though the earth be moved, * 
	and though the hills be carried into the midst of the sea;
3 Though its waters rage and swell, *
	and though the mountains shake at its tempest.
4 There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, * 
	the holy dwelling place of the Most High.
5 God is in the midst of her; therefore she shall not be moved. * 
	God shall help her at the break of day.
6 The nations are in an uproar, and the kingdoms are moved, * 
	but God has lifted his voice, and the earth shall melt away.
7 The Lord of hosts is with us; * 
	the God of Jacob is our refuge.
8 O come and behold the works of the Lord, *
	what devastations he has brought upon the earth.
9 He makes wars to cease in all the world; *
	he breaks the bow, and shatters the spear, 
         and burns the chariots in the fire.
10 “Be still then and know that I am God; *
	I will be exalted among the nations, 
         and I will be exalted in the earth.”
11 The Lord of hosts is with us; * 
	the God of Jacob is our refuge.

Psalm 47
1 O clap your hands together, all you peoples; * 
	O cry aloud unto God with shouts of joy.
2 For the Lord Most High is to be feared; * 
	he is the great King over all the earth. 
3 He shall subdue the peoples under us,* 
	and the nations under our feet.
4 He shall choose our inheritance for us, * 
	the pride of Jacob whom he loved.
5 God has gone up with a shout of triumph, * 
	the Lord with the sound of the trumpet.
6 O sing praises, sing praises unto our God; * 
	O sing praises, sing praises unto our King.
7 For God is the King of all the earth; *
	think upon his mighty acts and praise him with a song.
8 God reigns over the nations; * 
	God sits on his holy throne.
9 The princes of the peoples are gathered 
    with the people of the God of Abraham; *
		for the mighty upon earth have become 
         the servants of the Lord, and he is very highly exalted.

Psalm 48
1 Great is the Lord and highly to be praised *
	in the city of our God, even upon his holy hill.
2 The hill of Zion is beautiful and lofty; * 
	it is the joy of the whole earth.
3 Upon the north side lies the city of the great King; * 
	God is well known in her palaces as a sure refuge.
4 For behold, the kings of the earth * 
	have gathered and advanced together.
5 They marvelled to see such things; *
	they were astonished and fled in terror.
6 Trembling came upon them, and anguish, * 
	as upon a woman in travail.
7 You caused the east wind to blow *
	and broke apart the ships of Tarshish.
8 As we have heard, so have we seen 
    in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God; *
		God upholds her for ever.
9 We wait for your loving-kindness, O God, * 
	in the midst of your temple.
10 O God, according to your Name, 
    so is your praise to the world’s end; *
		your right hand is full of righteousness.
11 Let Mount Zion rejoice, and the cities of Judah be glad, * 
	because of your judgments.
12 Walk about Zion, and go round about her; * 
	count the number of her towers.
13 Mark well her bulwarks, consider her strongholds, * 
	that you may tell those who come after.
14 This God is our God for ever and ever; * 
	he shall be our guide, even unto death.

Psalm 49
1 Hear this, all you peoples; *
	ponder it with your ears, all who dwell in the world,
2 High and low, rich and poor, * 
	everyone with his neighbor.
3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom, *
	and my heart shall muse on understanding.
4 I will incline my ear to a parable, *
	and declare my dark sayings with the harp.
5  Why should I fear in the days of wickedness, *
	and when the wicked at my heels encompass me round about?
6 There are some who put their trust in their goods, * 
	and boast in the multitude of their riches.
7 But no one can deliver his brother, * 
	nor pay unto God a price for him;
8 For it is so costly to redeem their souls, *
	that we should never have enough to pay it,
9 So that they should live for ever * 
	and should not see the grave.
10 For we see that wise men die, as well as the ignorant and foolish; *
	they perish alike and leave their riches for others.
11 And yet they think that their houses shall continue for ever, 
	and that their dwelling places shall endure from one generation to another, *
		and they call lands after their own names.
12 Man is like an ox that has no understanding; * 
	he is like the beasts that perish.
13 This is the way of their foolishness, *
	yet their posterity praise their sayings.
14 Like sheep they are appointed to die, 
    and death shall be their shepherd; *
		they shall go down straight into the sepulchre.
15 Their beauty shall consume away in the grave, * 
	which shall be their dwelling place for ever.
16 But God shall save me from the power of death, * 
	for he shall deliver my soul.
17 Be not envious if one is made rich, *
	or if the glory of his house is increased,
18 For he shall carry nothing away with him when he dies, * 
	neither shall his glory follow him.
19 For while he lived, he counted himself happy, *
	and so long as he did well for himself, people spoke well of him.
20 He shall follow the generation of his fathers * 
	and shall never see the light.
21 Those who are honored but have no understanding * 
	are like the beasts that perish.

Psalm 50
1 The Lord, even the most mighty God, has spoken * 
    and called the world, 
         from the rising of the sun to the going down thereof.
2 Out of Zion, perfect in her beauty, * 
	has God shone forth in glory.
3 Our God shall come and shall not keep silence; *
	there shall go before him a consuming fire, 
		and a mighty tempest shall be stirred up round about him.
4 He shall call to the heavens above, *
	and to the earth beneath, that he may judge his people:
5 “Gather my faithful together unto me, *
	those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”
6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness, * 
	for God himself is Judge.
7 “Hear, O my people, and I will speak; *
	I myself will testify against you, 
         O Israel, for I am God, even your God.
8 I will not rebuke you because of your sacrifices, 
    or for your burnt offerings, *
		because they are always before me.
9 I will take no bull calf out of your house, * 
	nor he-goat out of your folds.
10 For all the beasts of the forest are mine, * 
	and so are the cattle upon a thousand hills.
11 I know all the birds of the air, *
	and the wild beasts of the field are in my sight.
12 If I were hungry, I would not tell you, *
	for the whole world is mine, and all that is therein.
13 Do you think that I will eat the flesh of bulls * 
	and drink the blood of goats?
14 Offer unto God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, * 
	and pay your vows unto the Most High;
15 And call upon me in the time of trouble; *
	so will I hear you, and you shall praise me.”
16 But to the ungodly God says: *
	“Why do you recite my laws, 
         and take my covenant in your mouth,
17 Though you hate to be disciplined, * 
	and have cast my words behind you?
18 When you saw a thief, you agreed with him, * 
	and you have taken part with adulterers.
19 You have let your mouth speak wickedness, *
	and with your tongue you have set forth deceit.
20 You sat and spoke against your brother; *
	yes, and have slandered your own mother’s son.
21 These things you have done, and I held my tongue, *
	and you thought wickedly that I am such a one as yourself.
22 But I will reprove you, *
	and set before you the things that you have done.
23 O consider this, you who forget God, *
	lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you.
24 Whoever offers me a sacrifice of thanksgiving honors me, * 
	and to him who orders his way aright 
         will I show the salvation of God.”

Psalm 51
1 Have mercy upon me, O God, in your great goodness; * 
	according to the multitude of your mercies 
         wipe away my offences.
2 Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness * 
	and cleanse me from my sin.
3 For I acknowledge my faults, * 
	and my sin is ever before me.
4 Against you only have I sinned, and done this evil in your sight, *
	so that you are justified in your sentence, 
         and blameless in your judgment.
5 Behold, I was brought forth in wickedness, * 
	and in sin my mother conceived me.
6 But behold, you desire truth in the inward parts * 
	and shall make me understand wisdom secretly.
7 You shall purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; * 
	you shall wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
8 You shall make me hear of joy and gladness, *
	that the bones which you have broken may rejoice.
9 Turn your face from my sins * 
	and blot out all my misdeeds.
10 Create in me a clean heart, O God, * 
	and renew a right spirit within me.
11 Cast me not away from your presence * 
	and take not your holy Spirit from me.
12 O give me the comfort of your help again * 
	and sustain me with your willing Spirit.
13 Then shall I teach your ways unto the wicked, * 
	and sinners shall return unto you.
14 Deliver me from blood-guilt, O God, the God of my salvation, *
	and my tongue shall sing of your righteousness.
15 O Lord, open my lips, *
	and my mouth shall show forth your praise.
16 For you desire no sacrifice, or else I would give it to you; * 
	but you delight not in burnt-offerings.
17 The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit; *
	a broken and contrite heart, O God, you shall not despise.
18 O be favorable and gracious unto Zion; * 
	may you build up the walls of Jerusalem.
19 Then you shall be pleased with the sacrifice of righteousness, with the burnt-offerings and oblations; *
	then shall they offer young bullocks upon your altar.

Psalm 52
1 Why do you boast, you tyrant, * 
	that you can do evil;
2 Whereas the goodness of God * 
	endures all the day long?
3 Your tongue devises wickedness, *
	and with lies you cut like a sharp razor.
4 You have loved unrighteousness more than goodness * 
	and to utter lies more than truth.
5 You have loved to speak all words that hurt, * 
	O you deceitful tongue.
6 Therefore, God shall destroy you for ever; *
	he shall catch you, and pluck you out of your dwelling, and root you out of the land of the living.
7 The righteous also shall see this and fear, * 
	and shall laugh him to scorn:
8 “Behold, this is the one who did not take God for his strength, *
	but trusted in the multitude of his riches and relied on his wickedness.”
9 As for me, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; * 
	my trust is in the tender mercy of God for ever and ever.
10 I will always give thanks unto you for what you have done, * 
	and I will declare your Name among the faithful, for it is good.

Psalm 53
1 The fool has said in his heart, * 
	“There is no God.”
2 They are corrupt and have become abominable in their wickedness; *
	there is none that does good.
3 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men * 
	to see if there were any who would understand and seek after God.
4 But they have all gone astray; they have altogether become abominable; *
	there is none that does good, no not one.
5 Have they no knowledge, all the workers of evil *
	who eat up my people as they would eat bread, and call not upon God?
6 They were afraid where no fear was, *
	for God has broken the bones of those who besieged you;
7 You have put them to shame, * 
	because God has rejected them.
8 Oh, that salvation were given unto Israel out of Zion! * 
	Oh, that God would deliver his people out of captivity!
9 Then shall Jacob rejoice, * 
	and Israel shall be glad.

Psalm 54
1 Save me, O God, for your Name’s sake, * 
	and avenge me in your strength.
2 Hear my prayer, O God, *
	and hearken to the words of my mouth.
3 For the arrogant have risen up against me, *
	and tyrants, who do not have God before their eyes, seek after my life.
4 Behold, God is my helper; *
	the Lord is he who upholds my life.
5 He shall repay the evil of my enemies. * 
	O destroy them in your faithfulness.
6 A freewill offering will I give you, *
	and praise your Name, O Lord, because it is good.
7 For he has delivered me out of all my trouble, * 
	and my eye has seen the ruin of my enemies.

Psalm 55
1 Hear my prayer, O God, *
	and hide not yourself from my petition.
2 Give heed to me, and hear me; *
	for I am troubled in my prayer and am tormented,
3 Because of the cry of the enemy, and oppression by the ungodly; *
	for they are of a mind to do me great harm, 
         so maliciously are they set against me.
4 My heart is disquieted within me, *
	and the fear of death has fallen upon me.
5 Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me, * 
	and a horrible dread has overwhelmed me.
6 And I said, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove, * 
	for then would I fly away and be at rest.
7 Indeed, then I would get away to a far off place * 
	and make my dwelling in the wilderness.
8 I would make haste to escape, *
	because of the stormy wind and tempest.”
9 Confuse their speech, O Lord, and divide them, *
	for I have seen unrighteousness and strife in the city.
10 Day and night they go about within her walls; * 
	trouble and sorrow are in the midst of her.
11 Great wickedness is there; *
	deceit and guile do not leave her streets.
12 For it is not an enemy who has done me this dishonor, * 
	for then I could have borne it;
13 Neither was it my adversary who exalted himself against me, * 
	for then I would have hidden myself from him.
14 But it was you, my companion, *
	my comrade and my own familiar friend.
15 We took sweet counsel together *
	and walked in the house of God as friends.
16 Let death come hastily upon them, 
    and let them go down alive into the grave; *
		for there is wickedness is in their hearts.
17 As for me, I will call upon God, * 
	and the Lord shall save me.
18 In the evening, and morning, 
    and at noonday will I pray and lament, *
		and he shall hear my voice.
19 It is he who shall deliver my soul in peace 
    from the battle that is against me, *
		for there are many who fight me.
20 God, who endures for ever, shall hear me, and bring them down; *
	for they never change, nor do they fear God.
21 My familiar friend has laid his hands 
    upon those who were at peace with him, *
		and he has broken his covenant.
22 The words of his mouth were softer than butter, 
    yet war was in his heart; *
		his words were smoother than oil, 
         and yet they were drawn swords.
23 O cast your burden upon the Lord, and he shall nourish you, * 
	and shall not allow the righteous to fall for ever.
24 But as for the bloodthirsty and deceitful, *
	you, O God, shall bring them into the pit of destruction.
25 They shall not live out half their days; * 
	but my trust shall be in you, O Lord.

Psalm 56
1 Be merciful to me, O God, for my adversaries are treading me down; *
	they are daily fighting and troubling me.
2 My enemies go about hounding me daily, *
	for there are many who fight against me, O Most High.
3 Nevertheless, though I am sometimes afraid, * 
	yet I put my trust in you.
4 In God whose word I praise, in God I trust and fear not, * 
	for what can flesh do to me?
5 They daily distort my words; *
	all that they imagine is to do me evil.
6  They all gather together and lie in wait, *
	and mark my steps, while they seek after my life.
7 Shall they escape despite their wickedness? * 
	O God, in your displeasure cast them down.
8 You record my lamentation; put my tears into your bottle; * 
	are not these things noted in your book?
9 Whenever I call upon you, then shall my enemies be put to flight; *
	this I know, for God is on my side.
10 In God, whose word I praise, *
	in the Lord, whose word I praise,
11 In God have I put my trust; *
	I will not be afraid, for what can mortals do to me?
12 Unto you, O God, will I pay my vows; * 
	unto you will I give thanks.
13 For you have delivered my soul from death 
    and my feet from stumbling, *
		that I may walk before God in the light of the living.

Psalm 57
1 Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me, 
    for my soul trusts in you; *
		and under the shadow of your wings shall be my refuge, 
         until this tribulation has passed.
2 I will call unto the Most High God, *
	even unto the God who shall fulfill his purpose for me.
3 He shall send from heaven and save me; he shall confound those who trample on me. *
	God shall send forth his mercy and truth.
4 My soul is among lions that devour the people; * 
	their teeth are spears and arrows, 
         and their tongue a sharp sword.
5 Exalt yourself, O God, above the heavens; * 
	let your glory be over all the earth.
6 They have laid a net for my feet, and brought down my soul; * 
	they dug a pit before me, 
         but have fallen into the midst of it themselves.
7 My heart is firmly fixed, O God, my heart is fixed; * 
	I will sing and give praise.
8 Awake, my soul, awake lute and harp; * 
	I myself will awaken the dawn.
9 I will give thanks unto you, O Lord, among the peoples, * 
	and I will sing praises unto you among the nations.
10 For the greatness of your mercy reaches unto the heavens, * 
	and your truth unto the clouds.
11 Exalt yourself, O God, above the heavens; * 
	let your glory be over all the earth.

Psalm 58
1 Do you indeed decree righteousness, O you rulers, * 
	and do you judge uprightly, O children of men?
2 No, you devise evil in your heart, *
	and on the earth your hands deal out violence.
3 The ungodly err even from their mother’s womb; *
	as soon as they are born, they go astray and speak lies.
4 They are as venomous as the poison of a serpent, * 
	even like the deaf adder that stops its ears,
5 Which refuses to hear the voice of the charmer, * 
	no matter how skillful his charming.
6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths; * 
	smite the jawbones of the ungodly.
7 Let them fall away like water that runs off; *
	let them wither like the grass that is trodden underfoot.
8 Let them melt away like a snail, *
	and be like a stillborn child that does not see the sun.
9 Before they bear fruit, let them be cut off like a briar; * 
	let them be like thorns and weeds that are swept away.
10 The righteous shall rejoice when they see the vengeance; * 
	they shall wash their feet in the blood of the ungodly.
11 So that people shall say, 
    “Truly, there is a reward for the righteous; *
		surely, there is a God who judges the earth.”

Psalm 59
1 Deliver me from my enemies, O God; *
	defend me from those who rise up against me.
2 O deliver me from the evildoers, * 
	and save me from the bloodthirsty.
3 For behold, they lie in wait for my soul; *
	the mighty are gathered against me, 
         without any offense or fault of mine, O Lord.
4 They run and prepare themselves without cause. * 
	Arise therefore to help me, and behold.
5 Rise up, O Lord God of hosts, O God of Israel, 
    to visit all the nations, *
		and be not merciful to those who offend 
         with malicious wickedness.
6 They go to and fro in the evening; *
	they howl like dogs, and run about through the city.
7 Behold, they boast with their mouths, and taunts are on their lips, *
	for they say, “Who will hear us?”
8 But you, O Lord, shall hold them in derision, * 
	and you shall laugh all the nations to scorn.
9 My strength I will ascribe unto you, * 
	for you are the God of my refuge.
10 God shows me his plenteous goodness, *
	and God shall let me look in triumph upon my enemies.
11 Slay them not, lest my people forget it, *
	but scatter them abroad by your might, 
         and put them down, O Lord our shield.
12 For the sin of their mouth, and for the words of their lips, 
    they shall be taken in their pride, *
		because their talk is cursing and lies.
13 Consume them in your wrath; consume them, 
    that they may perish, *
		and know that it is God who rules in Jacob, 
         and unto the ends of the world.
14 In the evening they will return, *
	howl like dogs, and run about through the city.
15 They will run here and there for meat * 
	and growl if they are not satisfied.
16 As for me, I will sing of your power, 
    and will praise your mercy early in the morning; *
		for you have been my defense and refuge 
         in the day of my trouble.
17 Unto you, O my strength, will I sing, *
	for you, O God, are my refuge, and my merciful God.

Psalm 60
1 O God, you have cast us out and scattered us abroad; * 
	you have been so displeased; O turn unto us again.
2 You have made the land to quake and divided it; * 
	heal the breaches in it, for it shakes.
3 You have made your people to drink a cup of bitterness; * 
	you have filled us with wine that makes us stagger.
4 You have set up a banner for those who fear you, * 
	that they may triumph because of the truth.
5 That your beloved may be delivered, *
	help me with your right hand and hear me.
6 God has spoken in his holiness: *
	“I will rejoice and divide Shechem, 
         and parcel out the valley of Succoth.
7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; *
	Ephraim also is the helmet for my head; Judah is my scepter.
8 Moab is my wash pot; on Edom I will cast my shoe; * 
	over Philistia will I shout in triumph.”
9 Who will lead me into the strong city? * 
	Who will bring me into Edom?
10 Have you not cast us out, O God? *
	Will you not, O God, go out with our armies?
11 O be our help in trouble, * 
	for vain is the help of man.
12 Through God we will do great acts, *
	for it is he who shall tread down our enemies.

Psalm 61
1  Hear my cry, O God; * 
	give ear unto my prayer.
2 From the ends of the earth I will call upon you * 
	when my heart is in heaviness.
3 O set me upon the rock that is higher than I, *
	for you have been my refuge 
         and a strong tower for me against the enemy.
4 Let me dwell in your tabernacle for ever, *
	and my refuge shall be under the covering of your wings.
5 For you, O God, have heard my vows, *
	and have given a heritage to those who fear your Name.
6 You shall grant the king a long life, *
	that his years may endure throughout all generations.
7 His throne shall abide before God for ever; *
	O prepare your loving mercy and faithfulness, 
         that they may preserve him.
8 So will I always sing praise unto your Name, * 
	that I may daily perform my vows.

Psalm 62
1 For God alone my soul in silence waits; * 
	from him comes my salvation.
2 He truly is my strength and my salvation; *
	he is my defense, so that I shall not be greatly shaken.
3 How long will you assail a man to crush him, all of you together, *
	as if you were a tottering wall or a broken fence?
4 Their plan is only to bring down the one whom God has exalted; *
	their delight is in lies; they bless with their mouth, 
         but curse with their heart.
5 Nevertheless, for God alone my soul in silence waits, * 
	for my hope is in him.
6 He truly is my strength and my salvation; * 
	he is my defense, so that I shall not fall.
7 In God is my help and my glory; *
	he is the rock of my might, and in him is my trust.
8 O put your trust in him always, you people; *
	pour out your hearts before him, for God is our hope.
9 As for the children of men, they are but a breath; *
	the children of men are deceitful; upon the scales, 
         they are altogether lighter than a breath.
10 O trust not in oppression; put not vain hopes in robbery; * 
	if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.
11 One thing has God spoken; indeed, 
    two things have I heard him say: *
		that power belongs to our God;
12 And that you, O Lord, are merciful, *
	for you reward everyone according to his work.

Psalm 63
1 O God, you are my God; * 
	early will I seek you.
2 My soul thirsts for you, my flesh also longs after you, * 
	in a barren and dry land where there is no water.
3 Thus I have looked upon you in your holy place, * 
	that I might behold your power and glory.
4 For your loving-kindness is better than life itself; * 
	my lips shall praise you.
5 As long as I live I will magnify you, * 
	and lift up my hands in your Name.
6 My soul shall be satisfied, as with marrow and fatness, * 
	when my mouth praises you with joyful lips.
7 When I remember you on my bed, *
	I meditate on you in the watches of the night.
8 Because you have been my helper, *
	therefore under the shadow of your wings I will rejoice.
9 My soul clings to you; *
	your right hand has upheld me.
10 Those who seek to destroy my life * 
	shall go down into the earth.
11 Let them fall upon the edge of the sword, * 
	that they may be a portion for jackals.
12 But the King shall rejoice in God; 
    all those who swear by him shall be commended, *
		for the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped.

Psalm 64
1 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer; * 
	preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
2 Hide me from the gathering together of the wicked, * 
	and from the tumult of evildoers;
3 Who have whet their tongue like a sword, * 
	and shoot out their arrows, even bitter words,
4 That they may secretly shoot at the one who is blameless; * 
	suddenly do they shoot him, and fear not.
5 They hold fast to their evil purpose, *
	and discuss among themselves how they may lay snares, 
         and say that no one shall see them.
6 They imagine wickedness, and practice a cunning plot; * 
	for the human heart and mind are very deep.
7 But God shall suddenly shoot at them with a swift arrow, * 
	and they shall be wounded.
8 Indeed, their own tongues shall make them fall, *
	so that all who see them shall laugh them to scorn.
9 And all shall fear and tell what God has done; * 
	for they shall perceive that it is his work.
10 The righteous shall rejoice in the Lord and put their trust in him, *
	and all who are true of heart shall be glad.

Psalm 65
1 You, O God, are to be praised in Zion, *
	and unto you shall vows be performed in Jerusalem.
2 You who hear our prayer, * 
	unto you shall all flesh come.
3 My misdeeds prevail against me; *
	O be merciful and blot out our sins.
4 Blessed is the man whom you choose and receive unto yourself; *
	he shall dwell in your courts and shall be satisfied with 
         the pleasures of your house, even of your holy temple.
5 You shall show us wonderful things in your righteousness, 
    O God of our salvation, *
		for you are the hope of all the ends of the earth 
         and of the isles that are far away;
6 You in your strength set firm the mountains, * 
	and are girded about with power;
7 You still the raging of the seas, *
	the noise of their waves and the tumult of the peoples.
8 Those who dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth 
    shall be in fear of your wonders; *
		you make the morning and evening to shout with joy.
9 You visit the earth and bless it; * 
	you make it very plenteous.
10 The river of God is full of water; *
	you prepare the grain, for so you provide for the earth.
11 You water its furrows; you send rain into the little valleys; * 
	you make it soft with the drops of rain 
         and bless the increase of it.
12 You crown the year with your goodness, * 
	and your paths overflow with plenty.
13 The fields of the wilderness are rich in pasture, * 
	and the little hills rejoice on every side.
14 The folds shall be full of sheep; *
	the valleys also shall stand so thick with grain 
         that they shall laugh and sing.

Psalm 66
1 Be joyful in God, all you lands; *
	sing praises to the honor of his Name; 
         make his praise to be glorious.
2 Say to God, “How wonderful are your works; *
	through the greatness of your power 
         shall your enemies cower before you.
3 For all the world shall worship you, * 
	sing to you, and praise your Name.”
4 O come and see the works of God, *
	how wonderful he is in his doing toward all people.
5 He turned the sea into dry land, 
    so that they went through the water on foot; *
		therefore in him let us rejoice.
6 He rules with his power for ever; 
    his eyes keep watch over the nations; *
		let not the rebellious exalt themselves.
7 Bless our God, you peoples, *
	and make the voice of his praise to be heard,
8 Who holds our soul in life, *
	and does not allow our feet to slip.
9 For you, O God, have proved us; * 
	you have tried us, as silver is tried.
10  You brought us into the snare * 
	and laid trouble upon our backs.
11 You allowed men to ride over our heads; 
    we went through fire and water; *
		but you brought us out into a place of plenty.
12 I will go into your house with burnt offerings * 
	and will pay you my vows,
13 Even those which I promised with my lips *
	and spoke with my mouth when I was in trouble.
14 I will offer you burnt sacrifices of fattened beasts, 
    with the incense of rams; *
		I will offer bullocks and goats.
15 Come here and listen, all you who fear God, * 
	and I will tell you what he has done for me.
16 I called to him with my mouth, *
	and gave him praises with my tongue.
17 If I had inclined toward wickedness with my heart, * 
	the Lord would not have heard me.
18 But God has heard me *
	and considered the voice of my prayer.
19 Blessed be God who has not refused my prayer, * 
	nor turned his mercy from me.

Psalm 67
1 May God be merciful unto us, and bless us, *
	and show us the light of his countenance, 
         and be merciful unto us.
2 Let your way be known upon earth, * 
	your saving health among all nations.
3 Let the peoples praise you, O God; * 
	indeed, let all the peoples praise you.
4 O let the nations rejoice and be glad, *
	for you shall judge the peoples righteously, 
         and govern the nations upon earth.
5 Let the peoples praise you, O God; * 
	let all the peoples praise you.
6 Then shall the earth bring forth her increase, *
	and God, even our own God, shall give us his blessing.
7 God shall bless us, *
	and all the ends of the world shall fear him.

Psalm 68
1 Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered; * 
	let those who hate him also flee before him.
2 As the smoke vanishes, so shall you drive them away; *
	and as wax melts before the fire, 
         so let the ungodly perish before the presence of God.
3 But let the righteous be glad and rejoice before God; * 
	let them also be merry and joyful.
4 O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name; 
    magnify him who rides upon the heavens. *
		The Lord is his Name; rejoice before him.
5 He is a father of the fatherless and defends 
    the cause of the widows, *
		God in his holy habitation.
6 He is the God who gives the solitary a home, 
    and brings the prisoners out of captivity, *
		but lets the rebellious dwell in a desert land.
7 O God, when you went forth before the people, * 
	when you went through the wilderness,
8 The earth shook, and the heavens poured forth rain 
    at the presence of God, *
		even as Sinai also was moved at the presence of God, 
         who is the God of Israel.
9 You, O God, sent a gracious rain upon your inheritance * 
	and refreshed the land when it was weary.
10 Your congregation found a dwelling there, *
	for you, O God, of your goodness have provided for the poor.
11 The Lord gave the word; *
	great was the company of those who proclaimed the tidings.
12 Kings with their armies fled, they fled, *
	and the women at home divided the spoil.
13 Though you have lain among the sheepfolds, *
	yet shall you be like the wings of a dove that are covered 
         with silver, and whose feathers shine like gold.
14 When the Almighty scattered kings, *
	it was as if it snowed in Zalmon.
15 As the hill of Bashan, so is God’s hill, * 
	even a high hill, as the hill of Bashan.
16 Why look with envy, you high hills? This is God’s hill, 
    on which it pleases him to dwell; *
		surely, the Lord will abide on it for ever.
17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, 
    even thousands of angels, *
		and the Lord has come from Sinai into the holy place.
18 You have gone up on high; you have led captivity captive, 
    and received gifts from men, *
		even from your enemies, 
         that the Lord God might dwell among them.
19 Praised be the Lord daily, *
	even the God who helps us and pours his benefits upon us.
20 He is our God, the God from whom salvation comes; * 
	God is the Lord, by whom we escape death.
21 God shall wound the head of his enemies, *
	and the hairy scalp of those who persist in their wickedness.
22 The Lord has said, “I will bring back my people again, 
    as I did from Bashan; *
		my own will I bring back again, 
         as I did before from the depths of the sea,
23 That your foot may be dipped in the blood of your enemies, * 
	and that the tongues of your dogs may be red with blood.”
24 Your solemn procession is seen, O God, *
	how you go into the sanctuary, my God and King.
25 The singers go before, the musicians follow after; * 
	in the midst are the maidens playing the timbrels.
26 Give thanks unto God in the congregations, * 
	unto the Lord, the fountain of Israel.
27 There is little Benjamin their ruler, 
    and the princes of Judah their counsel, *
		the princes of Zebulon, and the princes of Naphtali.
28 O God, send forth your strength ; *
	establish, O God, what you have wrought in us.
29 For your temple’s sake at Jerusalem * 
	kings shall bring presents unto you.
30 Rebuke the beasts that dwell among the reeds, * 
	a herd of bulls with their calves;
31 Rebuke the peoples who trample on those 
    whom you have tried as silver, *
		and scatter the peoples who delight in war.
32 Then shall they bring tribute out of Egypt; * 
	Ethiopia shall stretch out her hands unto God.
33 Sing unto God, O you kingdoms of the earth; * 
	O sing praises unto the Lord,
34 Unto God who sits in the heavens over all from the beginning; *
	he sends out his voice, his mighty voice.
35 Ascribe power to God over Israel; *
	his worship and strength are in the clouds.
36 O God, you are wonderful in your holy places; *
	the God of Israel will give strength 
         and power to his people. Blessed be God.

Psalm 69
1 Save me, O God, *
	for the waters have come up even to my neck.
2 I sink down in the deep mire, where there is no ground; * 
	I have come into deep waters, so that the floods run over me.
3 I am weary of crying; my throat is dry; *
	my sight fails me from waiting so long for my God.
4 Those who hate me without a cause 
    are more than the hairs of my head; *
		those who are my enemies, 
         and would destroy me wrongfully, are mighty.
5 They bid me restore things I never took. *
	O God, you know my foolishness, 
         and my faults are not hidden from you.
6 Let not those who trust in you, O Lord God of hosts, 
    be ashamed because of me; *
		let not those who seek you be confounded through me, 
         O God of Israel.
7 Surely for your sake have I suffered reproach; * 
	shame has covered my face.
8 I have become a stranger to my brethren, * 
	unknown to my mother’s children,
9 Because zeal for your house has consumed me, * 
	and the reproaches of those who reproached you 
         have fallen upon me.
10 I wept, and humbled myself with fasting, * 
	but that was turned to my reproach.
11 I put on sackcloth also, *
	and I became a byword among them.
12 Those who sit in the gate speak against me, * 
	and the drunkards make songs about me.
13 But, Lord, I make my prayer to you * 
	in an acceptable time.
14 Hear me, O God, in the multitude of your mercy, * 
	even in the truth of your salvation.
15 Take me out of the mire, lest I sink; *
	O let me be delivered from those who hate me, 
         and out of the deep waters.
16 Let not the floodwaters drown me, 
    neither let the deep swallow me up, *
		and let not the pit shut its mouth upon me.
17 Hear me, O Lord, for your loving-kindness is good; * 
	turn to me according to the multitude of your mercies;
18 And hide not your face from your servant, for I am in trouble; *
	O hasten and hear me.
19 Draw near to me and save me; *
	O deliver me because of my enemies.
20 You have known my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor; * 
	my adversaries are all in your sight.
21 Reproach has broken my heart; I am full of heaviness; *
	I looked for some to have pity on me, but there was no one,
         neither have I found any to comfort me.
22 They gave me gall to eat, *
	and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.
23 Let their table become a snare for them, *
	and let their prosperity become a trap for them.
24 Let their eyes be blinded, that they may not see, * 
	and make their loins tremble continually.
25 Pour out your indignation upon them, *
	and let your wrathful displeasure overtake them.
26 Let their habitation be desolate, * 
	and let no one dwell in their tents.
27 For they persecute him whom you have stricken, *
	and they talk of the pain of those you have wounded.
28 Lay to their charge guilt upon guilt, *
	and let them not receive your vindication.
29 Let them be wiped out of the book of the living, * 
	and not be written among the righteous.
30 As for me, when I am poor and in pain, * 
	your help, O God, shall lift me up.
31 I will praise the Name of God with a song, * 
	and magnify it with thanksgiving.
32 This also shall please the Lord *
	more than an ox or a bullock that has horns and hooves.
33 The humble shall consider this and be glad; * 
	seek after God and your hearts shall live.
34 For the Lord hears the poor *
	and does not despise his prisoners.
35 Let heaven and earth praise him, * 
	the sea, and all that moves therein.
36 For God will save Zion and build the cities of Judah, * 
	that they may dwell there and have it in possession.
37 The posterity of his servants shall inherit it, *
	and those who love his Name shall dwell therein.

Psalm 70
1 Hasten, O God, to deliver me; * 
	make haste to help me, O Lord.
2 Let them be ashamed and confounded who seek after my life;* 
	let them be turned back and put to confusion who wish me evil.
3 Let them be soon brought to shame * 
	who cry over me, “Aha! Aha!”
4 But let all those who seek you be joyful and glad in you; * 
	and let all who delight in your salvation say always, 
         “The Lord be praised.”
5 As for me, I am poor and in misery; * 
	hasten to me, O God.
6 You are my helper and my deliverer; * 
	O Lord, do not tarry.

Psalm 71
1 In you, O Lord, have I put my trust; * 
	let me never be put to shame.
2 Rescue me and deliver me in your righteousness; * 
	incline your ear to me and save me.
3 Be my rock and my refuge, where I may always return; * 
	you have promised to help me, 
         for you are my stronghold and my fortress.
4 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungodly, * 
	out of the hand of the unrighteous and the cruel.
5 For you, O Lord God, are the one I long for; * 
	you are my hope, even from my youth.
6 Through you have I been upheld ever since I was born; * 
	you took me out of my mother’s womb; 
         my praise shall be always of you.
7 I have become a portent to many; *
	but you are my refuge and my strength.
8  O let my mouth be filled with your praise *  
	that I may sing of your glory all the day long.
9 Cast me not away in the time of old age; * 
	forsake me not when my strength fails me.
10 For my enemies speak against me, 
    and those who lie in wait for my life take counsel together. *
		They say, “God has forsaken him; pursue him and take him, 
         for there is none to deliver him.”
11 Go not far from me, O God; *
	my God, make haste to help me.
12 Let those who are my adversaries be confounded and perish; * 
	let those who seek to do me evil be covered 
         with shame and dishonor.
13 As for me, I will always patiently abide, * 
	and will praise you more and more.
14 My mouth shall speak daily of your righteousness and salvation, *
	for I know not the end of them.
15 I will go forth in the strength of the Lord God, *
	and will make mention of your righteousness, yours alone.
16 You, O God, have taught me from my youth, *
	even to this day I am telling of your wondrous works.
17 Forsake me not, O God, in my old age, when I am gray-headed, *
	until I have proclaimed your strength to this generation, 
         and your power to all those who are yet to come.
18 Your righteousness, O God, reaches to the heavens; * 
	you have done great things. Who is like you, O God?
19 Oh, what great troubles and adversities you have shown me! 
    And yet you have turned and refreshed me; *
		indeed, you have brought me again from the depths of the earth.
20 You have brought me to great honor * 
	and comforted me on every side;
21 Therefore will I praise you and your faithfulness, O God, 
    playing on a stringed instrument; *
		to you will I sing with the harp, O Holy One of Israel.
22 My lips will rejoice when I sing to you, *
	and so will my soul, which you have delivered.
23 My tongue also shall speak of your righteousness 
    all the day long, *
		for they are confounded and brought to shame 
         who seek to do me evil.

Psalm 72
1 Give the King your judgments, O God, * 
	and your righteousness to the King’s son.
2 Then shall he judge your people with righteousness * 
	and defend the poor with justice.
3 The mountains also shall bring peace, *
	and the little hills righteousness to the people.
4 He shall vindicate the poor among the people, *
	defend the children of the poor, and punish the wrongdoer.
5 They shall fear you as long as the sun and moon endure, * 
	from one generation to another.
6 He shall come down like the rain upon the mown grass, * 
	even as showers that water the earth.
7  In his time shall the righteous flourish, *
	even an abundance of peace, so long as the moon endures.
8 His dominion shall be also from one sea to the other, * 
	and from the river unto the world’s end.
9 Those who dwell in the wilderness shall kneel before him; * 
	his enemies shall lick the dust.
10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall give presents; * 
	the kings of Arabia and Seba shall bring gifts.
11 All kings shall fall down before him; * 
	all nations shall do him service.
12 For he shall deliver the poor when he cries, *
	the needy also, and the one that has no helper.
13 He shall be favorable to the lowly and needy, * 
	and shall preserve the lives of the poor.
14 He shall deliver them from falsehood and wrong, * 
	and dear shall their blood be in his sight.
15 Long may he live! 
    And unto him shall be given the gold of Arabia; *
		prayer shall ever be made unto him, 
         and daily shall he be blessed.
16 There shall be an abundance of grain on the earth, 
    thick upon the hilltops; *
		its fruit shall flourish like Lebanon, 
         its grain like the grass upon the earth.
17 His Name shall endure for ever; 
    his Name shall remain as long as the sun. *
		All the nations shall be blessed through him 
         and shall call him blessed.
18 Blessed be the Lord God, even the God of Israel, * 
	who alone does wondrous things;
19 And blessed be the Name of his majesty for ever; * 
	and all the earth shall be filled with his majesty. Amen, Amen.

Psalm 73
1 Truly, God is loving to Israel, *
	even to those who have a clean heart.
2 Nevertheless, my feet had almost stumbled; * 
	my steps had nearly slipped.
3 For I was envious of the proud *
	when I saw the ungodly in such prosperity.
4 For they are in no fear of death, *
	but their bodies are healthy and strong.
5 They come to no misfortune like other folk, * 
	neither are they afflicted like others.
6 Therefore, they wear pride as a necklace, *
	and they wrap themselves with violence as with a garment.
7 Their eyes swell with greed, *
	and their hearts overflow with wicked thoughts.
8 Their talk is malice and mockery; *
	they have proud looks, and tyrannous words are on their lips.
9   For they set their mouth against the heavens, *  
	and their evil speech spreads through the world.
10 Therefore the people turn to them, * 
	and find no fault in them.
11 They say, “How should God perceive it? * 
	Is there knowledge in the Most High?”
12 Behold, these are the ungodly; *
	they prosper in their ways, and they have riches in possession.
13 I said, “Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart * 
	and washed my hands in innocence.”
14 All the day long have I been afflicted, * 
	and chastened every morning.
15 Indeed, had I spoken as they do, *
	then would I have betrayed the generation of your children.
16 When I sought to understand this, * 
	it was too hard for me,
17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; * 
	then I understood their end.
18 Surely, you set them in slippery places, * 
	and cast them down, and destroy them.
19 Oh, how suddenly are they consumed; * 
	they perish and come to a fearful end.
20 Indeed, like a dream when one awakens, *
	so shall you make their image vanish out of the city.
21 Thus my heart was grieved, * 
	and I was wounded within;
22 So foolish was I, and ignorant, * 
	as if I were a beast before you.
23 Nevertheless, I am always with you, * 
	for you hold me by my right hand.
24 You shall guide me with your counsel, * 
	and after that receive me with glory.
25 Whom have I in heaven but you? *
	And there is no one on earth 
         whom I desire in comparison with you.
26 Though my flesh and my heart fail me, *
	God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
27 For behold, those who forsake you shall perish; * 
	you destroy all those who are unfaithful to you.
28 But it is good for me to hold fast to God, 
    to put my trust in the Lord God, *
		and to speak of all your works in the gates of the city of Zion.

Psalm 74
1 O God, why have you utterly cast us off? *
	Why is your wrath so hot against the sheep of your pasture?
2 O think upon your congregation *
	whom you have purchased and redeemed of old.
3 Think upon the tribe of your inheritance, * 
	and Mount Zion, where you have dwelt.
4 Draw near and behold how all is made desolate *
	and how the enemy has destroyed all that is in your sanctuary.
5 Your adversaries roar in the midst of your holy place * 
	and set up their banners as tokens of victory.
6 Like hewers of timber in a thicket of trees, *
	so have they broken down all the carved work with axes and hammers.
7 They have set fire to your holy place *
	and have defiled the dwelling place of your Name, 
         even to the ground.
8 They said in their hearts, “Let us make havoc of them altogether.” *
	Thus have they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.
9 We do not see any signs; there is not one prophet anymore; * 
	there is no one who knows how long these things shall continue.
10 O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonor? * 
	How long shall the enemy blaspheme your Name, for ever?
11 Why do you withdraw your hand? *
	Why do you not take your right hand 
         out of your bosom to consume the enemy?
12 For God is my King of old; *
	he is the one bringing help upon the earth.
13 You divided the sea through your power; *
	you broke the heads of the dragons in the waters.
14 You smote the heads of Leviathan in pieces *
	and gave him to be food for the people in the wilderness.
15 You brought fountains and waters out of the hard rocks, * 
	and you dried up mighty waters.
16 The day is yours, and the night is yours; * 
	you have prepared the light and the sun.
17 You have set all the borders of the earth; * 
	you have made summer and winter.
18 Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy scoffed, *
	and how the foolish people have blasphemed your Name.
19 Deliver not the soul of your turtledove to the wild beasts, * 
	and forget not for ever the lives of your poor.
20 Look upon your covenant, *
	for the dark places of the earth are full of violence.
21 Let not the oppressed go away ashamed, *
	but let the poor and needy give praise to your Name.
22 Arise, O God, maintain your own cause; *
	remember how the foolish one blasphemes you daily.
23 Forget not the voice of your enemies, *
	nor the tumult of those who hate you, 
         which increases ever more and more.

Psalm 75
1 Unto you, O God, do we give thanks; * 
	indeed, unto you do we give thanks.
2 Those who call upon your Name * 
	declare your wondrous works.
3 “Surely at the time which I appoint, *
	I, the Lord, will judge according to what is right.
4 The earth shakes with fear, and all that dwell therein; * 
	but I, even I, have made firm its pillars.
5 I say to the proud, ‘You should not boast!’ *
	And to the ungodly, ‘Do not lift up your horn!
6 Do not lift up your horn on high, * 
	nor speak with a stiff neck.’”
7 For help comes neither from the east nor from the west, * 
	nor yet from the wilderness or the mountains.
8 For it is God who is the Judge; *
	he puts down one and lifts up another.
9 For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, 
    and the wine is foaming; *
		it is fully mixed, and he pours it out.
10 As for the dregs of it, *
	all the ungodly of the earth shall drink them and drain them out.
11 But I will magnify the God of Jacob * 
	and praise him for ever and ever.
12 All the horns of the ungodly will I break, *
	but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.

Psalm 76
1 In Judah God  is  known; *
	his Name is great in Israel.
2 At Salem is his tabernacle, * 
	and his dwelling is in Zion.
3 There he broke the arrows of the bow, *
	the shield, the sword, and the weapons of battle.
4 You are of more honor and might * 
	than the everlasting hills.
5 The strong of heart have been despoiled; 
    they have slept their sleep; *
		and all those whose hands were mighty have lost their strength.
6 At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, *
	both the chariot and horse lie stunned upon the ground.
7 You, even you, are to be feared, *
	and who may stand in your sight when you are angry?
8 You caused your judgment to be heard from heaven; *
	the earth trembled and was silent,
9 When God arose to judgment *
	and to help all the meek upon earth.
10 The wrath of man shall be turned to your praise, * 
	and the remnant of fierceness you shall restrain.
11 Make a vow unto the Lord your God and keep it, 
    all you who are round about him; *
		bring gifts unto him who is worthy to be feared.
12 He restrains the spirit of princes, *
	and is feared among the kings of the earth.

Psalm 77
1 I will cry unto God with my voice; *
	even unto God will I cry with my voice, 
         and he shall hearken unto me.
2 In the time of my trouble I sought the Lord; *
	my hands were stretched out in the night without rest; 
         my soul refused comfort.
3 When I think upon God, I groan; * 
	when I ponder, my spirit grows faint.
4 You hold my eyelids open; *
	I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
5 I consider the days of old; *
	I call to remembrance the years that are past.
6  In the night I commune with my own heart; * 
	I meditate and search my spirit.
7 Will the Lord cast me off for ever, * 
	and will he no more show his favor?
8 Is his mercy gone for ever, *
	and has his promise come utterly to an end for evermore?
9 Has God forgotten to be gracious, *
	and will he withhold his loving-kindness in displeasure?
10 And I said, “Has his right hand become weak; *
	has the hand of the Most High lost its strength?”
11 I will remember the works of the Lord, *  
	and call to mind your wonders of old time.
12 I will think also of all your works, * 
and my talk shall be of your deeds.
13 Your way, O God, is holy; *
who is so great a God as our God?
14 You are the God who does wonders *
and have declared your power among the peoples.
15 You have mightily delivered your people, * 
even the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
16 The waters saw you, O God; 
    the waters saw you and were afraid; *
the depths also were troubled.
17 The clouds poured out water; the skies thundered; * 
and your arrows flashed on every side.
18 The voice of your thunder was heard in the whirlwind; 
    the lightning lit up the world; *
the earth was moved and shook.
19 Your way was in the sea, and your paths in the great waters, * 
yet your footsteps were not seen.
20 You led your people like sheep *
by the hand of Moses and Aaron.


Psalm 78
1 Hear my teaching, O my people; *
incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
2 I will open my mouth in a parable; * 
I will utter dark sayings of old,
3 Which we have heard and known, *
and such as our forefathers have told us;
4 That we should not hide them from the children 
    of the generations to come, *
but show the honor of the Lord, 
         his mighty and wonderful works that he has done.
5 He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law, * 
which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children;
6 That their posterity might know it, *
and the children which were yet unborn;
7 With the intent that when they came up * 
they might show it to their children,
8    That they might put their trust in God, *  
and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments;
9 And not be as their forefathers, 
    a faithless and stubborn generation, *
a generation that did not set their heart aright,  
         and whose spirit did not cleave steadfastly to God;
10 Like the children of Ephraim, archers carrying bows, * 
who turned back in the day of battle.
11 They did not keep the covenant of God, * 
and would not walk in his law;
12 But forgot what he had done, *
and the wonderful works that he had shown them.
13 Marvelous things he did in the sight of our forefathers, * 
in the land of Egypt, even in the field of Zoan.
14 He divided the sea and let them go through; * 
he made the waters to stand in a heap.
15 In the daytime he led them with a cloud, *
and all the night through with a light of fire.
16 He split the hard rocks in the wilderness *
and gave them drink in abundance, as out of the great deep.
17 He brought waters out of the stony rock, * 
so that it gushed out like the rivers.
18 Yet for all this they sinned more against him, * 
and provoked the Most High in the wilderness.
19 They tested God in their hearts *
and demanded food for their craving.
20 They spoke against God, saying, *
“Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
21 Indeed, he smote the stony rock, so that water gushed out, and the streams overflowed; *
but can he give bread also, or provide meat for his people?”
22 When the Lord heard this, he was full of wrath; *
so a fire was kindled against Jacob, 
         and there flared up fierce anger against Israel,
23 Because they did not believe in God, * 
and did not put their trust in his help.
24 So he commanded the clouds above * 
and opened the doors of heaven.
25 He rained down manna upon them to eat * 
and gave them food from heaven.
26 So mortals ate the bread of angels; * 
for he sent them food enough.
27 He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, *
and through his power he brought in the south wind.
28 He rained meat upon them as thick as dust * 
and feathered fowl like the sand of the sea.
29 He let it fall among their tents, *  
even round about their habitations.
30 So they ate and were well filled, 
    for he gave them what they desired; *
they did not deny themselves their cravings,
31 But while the food was yet in their mouths, 
    the heavy wrath of God came upon them, 
         and slew the mightiest of them, *
and struck down the young men of Israel.
32 But for all this they sinned yet more, *
and did not believe his wondrous works.
33 Therefore he brought their days to an end as a breath * 
and their years in trouble.
34 When he slew them, they sought him, * 
and returned, and inquired after God.
35 And they remembered that God was their rock, * 
and the Most High God was their redeemer.
36 Nevertheless, they flattered him with their mouth * 
and spoke deceitfully to him with their tongue.
37 For their heart was not fixed on him, *
neither did they continue steadfast in his covenant.
38 But he was so merciful that he forgave their iniquities * 
and did not destroy them.
39 Indeed, many times he turned his wrath away * 
and would not permit his displeasure to arise.
40 For he considered that they were but flesh, *
that they were even as the wind 
         that passes away and comes not again.
41 Many times they provoked him in the wilderness * 
and grieved him in the desert.
42  They turned back, and tested God, * 
and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
43 They remembered not his power, *
nor the day when he delivered them from the hand of the enemy;
44 How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt * 
and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
45 He turned their waters into blood, *
so that they might not drink of the rivers.
46 He sent flies among them, which devoured them up, * 
and frogs to destroy them.
47 He gave their fruit to the grasshopper, * 
and their labor to the locust.
48 He destroyed their vines with hailstones * 
and their sycamore trees with the frost.
49 He smote their cattle also with hailstones * 
and their flocks with hot thunderbolts.
50 He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, 
    anger, displeasure, and trouble, *
sending these destroying angels among them.
51 He made a way for his indignation, 
    and did not spare their soul from death, *
but gave their life over to the pestilence,
52 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt, *
the firstfruits of their strength in the dwellings of Ham.
53 But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep * 
and carried them in the wilderness like a flock.
54 He brought them out safely, and they were not afraid; * 
he overwhelmed their enemies with the sea,
55 And brought them within the borders of his holy land, * 
to his mountain which he obtained with his right hand.
56 He cast out the nations before them, *
and caused their land to be divided among them 
         for an inheritance, and made the tribes 
              of Israel to dwell in their tents.
57 But they tested and displeased the Most High God, * 
and did not keep his testimonies,
58 But turned their backs and fell away like their forefathers, * 
twisting aside like a broken bow.
59 For they grieved him with their hill altars *
and provoked him to displeasure with their images.
60 When God heard this, he was full of wrath * 
and utterly rejected Israel;
61 So that he forsook the tabernacle in Shiloh, * 
even the tent that he had pitched among them.
62 He delivered the ark into captivity, * 
and his glory into the enemy’s hand.
63 He gave his people over to the sword * 
and was angry with his inheritance.
64 Fire consumed their young men, *
and their maidens had no marriage songs.
65 Their priests were slain with the sword, * 
and their widows made no lamentation.
66 Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, * 
and like a warrior recovered from wine.
67 He drove his enemies backward *
and put them to a perpetual shame.
68 He rejected the tabernacle of Joseph *
and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;
69 But chose the tribe of Judah, *
even the hill of Zion which he loved.
70 And there he built his sanctuary, like the heights of heaven, * 
like the earth which he had established for ever.
71 He chose David his servant, *
and took him away from the sheepfolds;
72 As he was following the ewes that were great with young, 
    God took him, *
that he might feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
73 So he fed them with a faithful and true heart, * 
and guided them with skillful hands.


Psalm 79
1  O God, the nations have come into your inheritance; * 
they have defiled your holy temple, 
         and made Jerusalem a heap of stones.
2 The dead bodies of your servants 
    have they given to be meat for the birds of the air, *
and the flesh of your saints to the beasts of the land.
3 Their blood have they shed like water 
    on every side of Jerusalem, *
and there was no one to bury them.
4 We have become a reproach to our enemies, *
an object of scorn and derision to those 
         who are round about us.
5  O Lord, how long will you be angry? * 
Shall your jealousy burn like fire for ever?
6 Pour out your indignation upon the nations 
    that have not known you, *
and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon your Name.
7 For they have devoured Jacob *
and laid waste his dwelling place.
8 O remember not our past sins, but have mercy on us speedily, * 
for we have come to great misery.
9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of your Name; * 
O deliver us and forgive our sins for your Name’s sake.
10 Why do the nations say, * 
“Where now is their God?”
11 O let the vengeance of your servants’ blood that is shed * 
be known in our sight among the nations.
12 O let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners come before you; * 
according to the greatness of your power, 
         preserve those who are condemned to die.
13 As for the blasphemy 
    by which our neighbors have blasphemed you, *
repay them, O Lord, seven-fold into their bosoms.
14 So we, who are your people and the sheep of your pasture, 
    shall give you thanks for ever,*
and will always be showing forth your praise 
         from generation to generation.
Psalm 80
1 Hear, O Shepherd of Israel, you that lead Joseph like a sheep;* 
show yourself also, you that sit upon the cherubim.
2 Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, * 
stir up your strength and come to help us.
3 Restore us again, O God; *
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be whole.
4 O Lord God of hosts, *
how long will you be angry with your people that pray?
5 You feed them with the bread of tears * 
and give them plenteous tears to drink.
6 You have made us the derision of our neighbors, * 
and our enemies laugh us to scorn.
7 Restore us again, O God of hosts; *
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be whole.
8 You have brought a vine out of Egypt; *
you have cast out the nations and planted it.
9 You made room for it, *
and when it had taken root it filled the land.
10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, *
and the boughs thereof were like the mighty cedar trees.
11 It stretched out its branches to the sea * 
and its boughs to the river.
12 Why have you broken down her hedge, *
so that all those who go by pluck off her grapes?
13 The wild boar out of the wood roots it up, * 
and the wild beasts of the field devour it.
14 Turn again, O God of hosts, look down from heaven; * 
behold, and visit this vine,
15 And the place of the vineyard that your right hand has planted, *
and the branch that you made so strong for yourself.
16 As for those who burn it with fire and cut it down, * 
let them perish at the rebuke of your countenance.
17 Let your hand be upon the man of your right hand * 
and upon the son of man, 
         whom you made so strong for yourself.
18 And so we will not turn back from you; *
O let us live, and we shall call upon your Name.
19 Restore us again, O Lord God of hosts; *
show the light of your countenance, and we shall be whole.


Psalm 81
1 O Sing merrily unto God our strength; *
make a cheerful noise unto the God of Jacob.
2 Take the psalm, bring hither the timbrel, * 
the merry harp with the lute.
3 Blow the trumpet at the new moon, *
even in the time appointed, and on our solemn feast day.
4 For this was made a statute for Israel * 
and a law of the God of Jacob.
5 This he laid upon Joseph for a testimony, * 
when he came out of the land of Egypt.
6 I eased his shoulder from the burden, *
and his hands were delivered from bearing the load.
7  You called upon me in troubles, and I delivered you, * 
and I answered you in the thundercloud 
         and tested you at the waters of strife.
8 Hear, O my people, and I will admonish you: * 
O Israel, if you will hearken unto me,
9 There shall be no strange god among you, * 
neither shall you worship any other god.
10 “I am the Lord your God, 
    who brought you out of the land of Egypt; *
open your mouth wide, and I shall fill it.
11 But my people would not hear my voice, * 
and Israel would not obey me.
12 So I gave them up to the stubbornness of their hearts, * 
and let them follow their own imaginations.
13 Oh, that my people would have hearkened unto me, * 
that Israel had walked in my ways.
14 I would soon have put down their enemies * 
and turned my hand against their adversaries.
15 The haters of the Lord would humble themselves before him, *
and their time of punishment would endure for ever.
16 But Israel would I feed with the finest wheat-flour, *
and with honey out of the stony rock would I satisfy him.”


Psalm 82
1 God stands in the council of princes; * 
he is a Judge among gods.
2 “How long will you give wrong judgment * 
and accept the ungodly?
3 Defend the poor and fatherless; *
see that those who are in need and necessity have what is right.
4 Deliver the outcast and poor; *
save them from the hand of the ungodly.”
5 They will not learn nor understand, but walk about in darkness; *
all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
6 I have said, “You are gods, *
and you are all the children of the Most High;
7 But you shall die like mortals, * 
and fall like one of the princes.”
8 Arise, O God, and judge the earth, *
for you shall take all nations for your inheritance.


Psalm 83
1 Hold not your tongue, O God; keep not silent, * 
but rouse yourself, O God.
2 For behold, your enemies murmur, *
and those who hate you have lifted up their head.
3 They have conspired secretly against your people * 
and taken counsel against your cherished ones.
4 They have said, “Come, and let us wipe them out, 
    that they may be no more a people, *
and that the name of Israel may be remembered no more.”
5 For they have brought their heads together with one consent * 
and are aligned against you:
6 The tents of the Edomites and the Ishmaelites, * 
the Moabites and Hagarenes,
7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek, *
the Philistines with those who dwell at Tyre.
8 Assyria also has joined with them, * 
and has helped the children of Lot.
9   But do to them as you did to the Midianites, * 
to Sisera and to Jabin at the brook of Kishon,
10 Who perished at Endor *
and became as dung on the earth.
11 Make their princes like Oreb and Zeëb; *
indeed, make all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
12 Who said, “Let us take for ourselves * 
the pastures of God as our possession.”
13 O my God, make them like whirling dust * 
and like stubble before the wind,
14 Like the fire that burns up the woods *
and like the flame that consumes the mountains.
15 Pursue them even with your tempest, * 
and make them afraid with your storm.
16 Cover their faces with shame, O Lord, * 
that they may seek your Name.
17 Let them be disgraced and dismayed ever more and more; * 
let them be put to shame and perish;
18 And they shall know that you, whose Name is the Lord, * 
are alone the Most High over all the earth.


Psalm 84
1 How lovely are your dwellings, * 
O Lord God of hosts!
2 My soul has a desire and longing to enter 
    into the courts of the Lord; *
my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God.
3 Indeed, the sparrow has found her a house, 
    and the swallow a nest where she may lay her young, *
even your altars, O Lord of hosts, my King and my God.
4 Blessed are they who dwell in your house; * 
they will be always praising you.
5 Blessed is the one whose strength is in you, * 
in whose heart are your ways,
6 Who going through the valley of misery uses it for a well; * 
indeed, the early rains fill the pools with water.
7 They will go from strength to strength, *
and the God of gods shall be seen by them in Zion.
8 O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer; * 
hearken, O God of Jacob.
9 Behold, O God, our defender, *
and look upon the face of your Anointed.
10 For one day in your courts * 
is better than a thousand;
11 I would rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God * 
than dwell in the tents of ungodliness.
12 For the Lord God is a light and defense; *
the Lord will give grace and honor, 
         and no good thing shall he withhold 
              from those who live a godly life.
13 O Lord God of hosts, *
blessed is the one who puts his trust in you.


Psalm 85
1 Lord, you have been gracious to your land; * 
you have turned away the captivity of Jacob.
2 You have forgiven the offence of your people * 
and covered all their sins.
3 You have taken away all your displeasure *
and turned yourself from your wrathful indignation.
4 Restore us then, O God our Savior, * 
and let your anger cease from us.
5 Will you be displeased at us for ever, *
and will you stretch out your wrath 
         from one generation to another?
6 Will you not turn again and quicken us, * 
that your people may rejoice in you?
7 Show us your mercy, O Lord, * 
and grant us your salvation.
8 I will hearken to what the Lord God will say, *
for he shall speak peace unto his people, 
         and to his saints, that they turn not again.
9 For his salvation is near to those who fear him, * 
that glory may dwell in our land.
10 Mercy and truth have met together; * 
righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
11 Truth shall flourish out of the earth, *
and righteousness shall look down from heaven.
12 Indeed, the Lord shall show goodness, * 
and our land shall give its increase.
13 Righteousness shall go before him, *
and he shall direct his going in the way.


Psalm 86
1 Bow down your ear, O Lord, and hear me, * 
for I am poor and in misery.
2 Preserve my life, for I am faithful; *
my God, save your servant who puts his trust in you.
3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord, * 
for I will call daily upon you.
4 Comfort the soul of your servant, *
for to you, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
5 For you, Lord, are good and gracious, *
and of great mercy to all those who call upon you.
6 Give ear, Lord, unto my prayer, *
and attend to the voice of my humble supplications.
7 In the time of my trouble I will call upon you, * 
for you answer me when I call.
8 Among the gods there is none like you, O Lord, * 
nor are there any deeds like yours.
9 All nations that you have made shall come and worship you, O Lord, *
and shall glorify your Name.
10 For you are great and do wondrous things; * 
indeed, you are God alone.
11 Teach me your way, O Lord, and I will walk in your truth; * 
O knit my heart to you, that I may fear your Name.
12 I will thank you, O Lord my God, with all my heart, * 
and will praise your Name for evermore.


Psalm 87
1 The Lord loves the foundation 
    which he has laid upon the holy hills; *
the gates of Zion are dearer to him 
         than all the dwellings of Jacob.
2 Very excellent things are spoken of you, * 
O city of God.
3 I will consider Egypt and Babylon * 
among those who know me.
4 Behold Philistia also, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; * 
each one was born in her.
5 And of Zion it shall be reported that each one was born in her, * 
and the most High shall establish her.
6 The Lord shall record it when he registers the people, * 
that each one was born there.
7 The singers and the dancers also shall say, * 
“All my fresh springs are in you.”


Psalm 88
1 O Lord God of my salvation, 
    I have cried day and night before you; *
O let my prayer enter into your presence; 
         incline your ear to my call.
2 For my soul is full of trouble, *
and my life draws nigh to the grave.
3 I am counted as one of those who go down into the pit, * 
and I have become as one who has no strength.
4 I have become like the dead, 
    and like the slain who lie in the grave, *
whom you remember no more, 
         and who are cut off from your hand.
5 You have laid me in the lowest pit, *
in a place of darkness, and in the deep.
6 Your indignation lies heavy upon me, *
and you have overwhelmed me with all your storms.
7 You have put my friends far from me, * 
and made me to be abhorred by them.
8 I am in prison; *
I cannot go forth.
9 My sight fails because of trouble; *
Lord, I have called daily upon you; 
         I have stretched forth my hands unto you.
10 Do you show wonders among the dead, *
or shall the dead rise up again and praise you?
11 Shall your loving-kindness be shown in the grave, * 
or your faithfulness in destruction?
12 Shall your wondrous works be known in the dark, * 
and your righteousness in the land 
         where all things are forgotten?
13 Unto you have I cried, O Lord, *
and early shall my prayer come before you.
14 Lord, why do you cast off my soul * 
and hide your face from me?
15 I am in misery, like one who is at the point of death; * 
even from my youth, 
         your terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind.
16 Your wrathful displeasure goes over me, * 
and the fear of you has undone me.
17 Daily they come round about me like water, * 
and encompass me on every side.
18 My companions and neighbors you have put away from me, * 
and hidden my friends out of my sight.


Psalm 89
1 My song shall be always of the loving-kindness of the Lord; * 
with my mouth will I ever be proclaiming your faithfulness, 
         from one generation to another.
2 For I have said, “Mercy shall be built up for ever; *
your faithfulness shall be established in the heavens.”
3 I have made a covenant with my chosen one; * 
I have sworn to David my servant:
4 “Your seed will I establish for ever, *
and set up your throne from one generation to another.”
5 O Lord, the heavens will praise your wondrous works * 
and your faithfulness in the assembly of the saints.
6 For who in the clouds can be compared unto the Lord? * 
And who among the gods is like unto the Lord?
7 God is greatly to be feared in the council of the saints, * 
and to be held in reverence by all those 
         who are round about him.
8 O Lord God of hosts, who is like you? *
Your faithfulness, most mighty Lord, is round about you.
9 You rule the raging of the sea; *
you still the waves when they arise.
10 You have subdued Rahab of the deep, and destroyed her; * 
you have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.
11 The heavens are yours; the earth also is yours; *
you laid the foundation of the world, and all that is in it.
12 You have made the north and the south; *
Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in your Name.
13 You have a mighty arm; *
strong is your hand, and high is your right hand.
14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; * 
mercy and truth shall go before your face.
15 Blessed are the people, O Lord, who rejoice in you; * 
they shall walk in the light of your countenance.
16 Their delight shall be in your Name all the day long, * 
and in your righteousness shall they make their boast.
17 For you are the glory of their strength, *
and by your favor you shall lift up our might.
18 For the Lord is our defense; *
the Holy One of Israel is our King.
19 You spoke in a vision to your saints, and said, *
“I have set the crown upon one who is mighty; 
         I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
20 I have found David my servant; *
with my holy oil have I anointed him.
21 My hand shall hold him fast, *
and my arm shall strengthen him.
22 The enemy shall not be able to do him violence; * 
the son of wickedness shall not hurt him.
23 I will smite his foes before his face * 
and strike down those who hate him.
24 My faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him, * 
and in my Name shall his horn be exalted.
25 I will give him dominion over the sea, *
and with his right hand shall he rule the rivers.
26 He shall say to me, “You are my Father, * 
my God and the rock of my salvation.”
27 And I will make him my firstborn, * 
higher than the kings of the earth.
28 My mercy will I keep for him for ever, *
and my covenant shall stand fast with him.
29 His seed will I make to endure for ever * 
and his throne as the days of heaven.
30 But if his children forsake my law, * 
and do not walk in my judgments,
31 If they break my statutes and do not keep my commandments,* 
I will punish their offenses with the rod, 
         and their sin with scourges.
32 Nevertheless, my loving-kindness I will not utterly take from him, *
nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
33 My covenant I will not break, *
nor alter the word that has gone out of my lips.
34 I have sworn once by my holiness * 
that I will not fail David.
35 His seed shall endure for ever *
and his throne as the sun before me.
36 It shall endure for evermore as the moon, * 
and as the faithful witness in the heavens.
37 But you have rejected and forsaken your Anointed; * 
you are full of wrath against him.
38 You have broken the covenant with your servant; *
you have defiled his crown and cast it to the ground.
39 You have overthrown all his walls * 
and broken down his strongholds.
40 All those who go by plunder him, *
and he has become a reproach to his neighbors.
41 You have exalted the right hand of his enemies, * 
and made all his adversaries rejoice.
42 You have turned back the edge of his sword * 
and have not given him victory in the battle.
43 You have taken away his glory *
and cast his throne down to the ground.
44 The days of his youth you have shortened * 
and covered him with dishonor.
45 Lord, how long will you utterly hide yourself? * 
How long shall your wrath burn like fire?
46 O remember how short my time is; *
why have you made all people for nought?
47 What man is there who lives and shall not see death, * 
and shall deliver his soul from the power of the Grave?
48 Lord, where are your loving-kindnesses of old, * 
which you swore to David in your faithfulness?
49 Remember, Lord, how your servants are reproached, *
and how I bear in my bosom the rebukes of many people;
50 Remember how your enemies have reproached you, O Lord; * 
how they have called after your Anointed King 
         with cries of scorn.
51 Praised be the Lord for evermore. * 
Amen and Amen.


Psalm 90
1 Lord, you have been our refuge * 
from one generation to another.
2 Before the mountains were brought forth, 
    or the earth and the world were made, *
you are God from everlasting, and world without end.
3 You turn man back to the dust; *
you say, “Return, O children of men.”
4 For a thousand years in your sight are as yesterday, * 
even as a day that is past.
5 You scatter them as a night-watch that comes quickly to an end;* 
they are even as a dream and fade away.
6 They are like the grass, which in the morning is green, * 
but in the evening is dried up and withered.
7 For we consume away in your displeasure * 
and are afraid at your wrathful indignation.
8 You have set our misdeeds before you, *
and our secret sins in the light of your countenance.
9 For when you are angry, all our days are gone; *
we bring our years to an end, as a tale that is told.
10 The days of our life are seventy years, 
    and though some be so strong 
         that they come to eighty years, *
yet is their span but labor and sorrow; 
              so soon it passes away, and we are gone.
11 But who regards the power of your wrath, *
and who considers the fierceness of your anger?
12 So teach us to number our days *
that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
13 Turn again, O Lord, and tarry not; * 
be gracious unto your servants.
14 O satisfy us with your mercy in the morning; *
so shall we rejoice and be glad all the days of our life.
15 Comfort us again, according to the measure of the days that you have afflicted us, *
and for the years in which we have suffered adversity.
16 Show your servants your work * 
and their children your glory.
17 And may the grace of the Lord our God be upon us; * 
prosper the work of our hands, O prosper our handiwork.


Psalm 91
1 Whoever dwells under the defense of the Most High * 
shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
2 I will say unto the Lord, “You are my refuge and my stronghold, *
my God in whom I will trust.”
3 For he shall deliver you from the snare of the hunter * 
and from the deadly pestilence.
4 He shall defend you under his wings, 
    and you shall be safe under his feathers; *
his faithfulness and truth shall be your shield and buckler.
5 You shall not be afraid of any terror by night, * 
nor of the arrow that flies by day,
6 Of the pestilence that walks in darkness, *
nor of the sickness that destroys at noonday.
7 A thousand shall fall beside you, 
    and ten thousand at your right hand, *
but it shall not come near you.
8 Indeed, with your eyes you shall behold * 
and see the reward of the ungodly.
9 Because you have said, “the Lord is my refuge,” * 
and have made the Most High your stronghold,
10 There shall no evil happen to you, *
neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.
11 For he shall give his angels charge over you, * 
to keep you in all your ways.
12 They shall bear you in their hands, *
that you hurt not your foot against a stone.
13 You shall tread upon the lion and adder; *
the young lion and the serpent you shall trample under your 
         feet.
14 “Because he has set his love upon me, 
    therefore I will deliver him; *
I will lift him up, because he has known my Name.
15 He shall call upon me, and I will hear him; *
indeed, I am with him in trouble; 
         I will deliver him and bring him honor.
16 With long life I will satisfy him, * 
and show him my salvation.”


Psalm 92
1 It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, *
and to sing praises unto your Name, O Most High;
2 To tell of your loving-kindness early in the morning, * 
and of your faithfulness in the night season;
3 Upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the lute, * 
with the sound of melody upon the harp.
4 For you, Lord, have made me glad by your deeds, * 
and I will shout for joy because of your handiwork.
5 O Lord, how glorious are your works; * 
your thoughts are very deep.
6 The dull of heart does not consider this, * 
and a fool does not understand it:
7 Though the ungodly are as green as the grass, 
    and though all the workers of wickedness flourish, *
they shall be destroyed for ever; 
         but you, Lord, are the Most High for evermore.
8 For lo, your enemies, O Lord, lo, your enemies shall perish, * 
and all the workers of wickedness shall be destroyed.
9 But my horn shall be exalted like the horns of wild bulls; * 
for I am anointed with fresh oil.
10 My eye also shall see its desire upon my enemies, * 
and my ear shall hear with joy 
         the end of the wicked who rise up against me.
11 The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree, *
and shall spread abroad like a cedar in Lebanon.
12 Those who are planted in the house of the Lord * 
shall flourish in the courts of our God.
13 They also shall bring forth fruit in their old age, * 
and shall be green and full of sap,
14 That they may show how upright the Lord is, * 
my rock, in whom there is no unrighteousness


Psalm 93
1 The Lord is King and has put on glorious apparel; * 
the Lord has put on his apparel and girded himself with strength.
2 He has made the round world so sure * 
that it cannot be moved.
3 Ever since the world began, your throne has been established; * 
you are from everlasting.
4 The floods have risen, O Lord; 
    the floods have lifted up their voice; *
the floods have lifted up their waves.
5 Mightier than the sound of many waters, 
    mightier than the waves of the sea, *
the Lord who dwells on high is mightier.
6 Your testimonies, O Lord, are very sure; * 
holiness adorns your house for ever.


Psalm 94
1 O Lord God to whom vengeance belongs, *
O God to whom vengeance belongs, show yourself.
2 Arise, O Judge of the world, *
and reward the proud according to their deserving.
3 O Lord, how long shall the ungodly, * 
how long shall the ungodly triumph?
4 How long shall all evildoers speak so disdainfully * 
and make such proud boasting?
5 They smite down your people, O Lord, * 
and trouble your heritage.
6 They murder the widow and the stranger * 
and put the fatherless to death.
7 And yet they say, “The Lord shall not see, * 
neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.”
8 Take heed, you unwise among the people; * 
O you fools, when will you understand?
9 He who planted the ear, shall he not hear? * 
Or he who made the eye, shall he not see?
10 Or he who nurtures the nations, *
he who teaches humanity knowledge, shall he not punish?
11 The Lord knows the thoughts of man, *
that they are but vain.
12 Blessed is the one whom you chasten, O Lord, * 
and whom you teach your law,
13 That you may give him patience in time of adversity, *
until a pit is dug for the ungodly.
14 For the Lord will not fail his people, * 
neither will he forsake his inheritance;
15 But righteousness shall return to the place of judgment, * 
and all those who are true of heart shall follow it.
16 Who will rise up with me against the wicked, * 
or who will take my part against the evildoers?
17 If the Lord had not helped me, *
my soul would soon have dwelt in the land of silence.
18 But when I said, “My foot has slipped,” * 
your mercy, O Lord, held me up.
19 In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart, * 
your comforts refreshed my soul.
20 Will you have anything to do with the council of wickedness, * 
which turns evil into law?
21 They gather themselves together against 
    the soul of the righteous *
and condemn the innocent to death.
22 But the Lord is my refuge, *
and my God is the rock of my confidence.
23 He shall recompense them for their wickedness, 
    and destroy them in their own malice; *
indeed, the Lord our God shall destroy them.


Psalm 95
1 O come, let us sing unto the Lord; *
let us heartily rejoice in the strength of our salvation.
2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving * 
and show ourselves glad in him with psalms.
3 For the Lord is  a  great  God  * 
and a great King above all gods.
4 In his hand are all the depths of the earth * 
and the heights of the hills are his also.
5 The sea is his, for he made it, *
and his hands prepared the dry land.
6 O come, let us worship and fall down, * 
and kneel before the Lord our Maker.
7 For he is our God, *
and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.
8 Today, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts * 
as in the provocation, 
         and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness,
9 When your fathers tested me, *
and put me to the proof, though they had seen my works.
10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation and said, * 
“It is a people that err in their hearts, 
         for they have not known my ways,”
11 Of whom I swore in my wrath *
that they should not enter into my rest.


Psalm 96
1 O sing unto the Lord a new song; *
sing unto the Lord, all the whole earth.
2 Sing unto the Lord and praise his Name; * 
tell of his salvation from day to day.
3 Declare his honor to the nations, * 
and his wonders to all peoples.
4 For the Lord is great, and highly to be praised; * 
he is more to be feared than all gods.
5 As for all the gods of the nations, they are but idols; * 
but it is the Lord who made the heavens.
6 Glory and majesty are before him; * 
power and honor are in his sanctuary.
7 Ascribe unto the Lord, O you families of the peoples, * 
ascribe unto the Lord worship and power.
8 Ascribe unto the Lord the honor due unto his Name; * 
bring offerings and come into his courts.
9 O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness; * 
let the whole earth stand in awe of him.
10 Tell it out among the nations, “The Lord is King;*
it is he who has made the world so firm that it cannot be moved; 
         he shall judge the peoples righteously.”
11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad;* 
let the sea make a noise, and all that is therein.
12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it;*
then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord.
13 For he comes, for he comes to judge the earth, *
and with righteousness to judge the world, 
         and the peoples with his truth.


Psalm 97
1 The Lord is King; let the earth be glad. * 
Indeed, let the multitude of the isles be glad.
2 Clouds and darkness are round about him; * 
righteousness and judgment are the foundation of his throne.
3 There goes a fire before him *
and burns up his enemies on every side.
4 His lightnings gave light to the world; * 
the earth saw it and was afraid.
5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord, * 
at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
6 The heavens have declared his righteousness, * 
and all the people have seen his glory.
7 Confounded be all those who worship carved images, 
    and who delight in false gods; *
worship him, all you gods.
8 Zion heard of it and rejoiced, *
and the daughters of Judah were glad 
         because of your judgments, O Lord.
9 For you, Lord, are most high over all the earth; * 
you are exalted far above all gods.
10 O you who love the Lord, 
    see that you hate the thing which is evil; *
the Lord preserves the souls of his saints; 
         he shall deliver them from the hand of the ungodly.
11 A light has sprung up for the righteous, *
and joyful gladness for those who are truehearted.
12 Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous, *
and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.


Psalm 98
1 O sing unto the Lord a new song, * 
for he has done marvelous things.
2 With his own right hand and with his holy arm, * 
he has won for himself the victory.
3 The Lord declared his salvation; *
his righteousness has he openly shown in the sight of the nations.
4 He has remembered his mercy and truth 
    toward the house of Israel, *
and all the ends of the world have seen 
         the salvation of our God.
5 Show yourselves joyful in the Lord, all you lands; * 
sing, rejoice, and give thanks.
6  Praise the Lord with the harp; *
sing with the harp a psalm of thanksgiving.
7 With trumpets also and horns, *
O show yourselves joyful before the Lord the King.
8 Let the sea make a noise, and all that is in it, *
the round world, and those who dwell therein.
9 Let the rivers clap their hands, 
    and let the hills be joyful together before the Lord, *
for he has come to judge the earth.
10 With righteousness shall he judge the world * 
and the peoples with equity.


Psalm 99
1 The Lord is King; let the peoples tremble; *
he sits between the cherubim; let the earth shake.
2 The Lord is great in Zion * 
and high above all peoples.
3 They shall give thanks unto his Name, 
    which is great and wonderful; *
holy is he and mighty, a King who loves justice.
4 You have established equity; *
you have executed judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
5 O magnify the Lord our God, *
and fall down before his footstool, for he is holy.
6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, 
    and Samuel among those who call upon his Name, *
they called upon the Lord, and he heard them.
7 He spoke to them out of the cloudy pillar, *
for they kept his testimonies and the law that he gave them.
8 You heard them, O Lord our God; *
you forgave them, O God, yet punished their evildoings.
9 O magnify the Lord our God, and worship him upon his holy hill, *
for the Lord our God is holy.


Psalm 100
1 O be joyful in the Lord, all you lands; *
serve the Lord with gladness, 
         and come before his presence with a song.
2 Be assured that the Lord, he is God; *
it is he that has made us, and not we ourselves; 
         we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
3 O go your way into his gates with thanksgiving, 
    and into his courts with praise; *
be thankful unto him, and speak good of his Name.
4    For the Lord is gracious, his mercy is everlasting, * 
and his truth endures from generation to generation.


Psalm 101
1 My song shall be of mercy and judgment; * 
unto you, O Lord, will I sing.
2 O let me have understanding * 
in the way of godliness.
3 When will you come to me? *
I will walk in my house with integrity of heart.
4 I will set no wicked thing before my eyes; *
I hate the sins of unfaithfulness; 
         no such thing shall cleave to me.
5 A crooked heart shall depart from me; * 
I will not know a wicked person.
6 Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor,* 
him will I destroy.
7 Whoever has a proud look and an arrogant heart, * 
I will not suffer him.
8 My eyes shall look with favor upon the faithful in the land, * 
that they may dwell with me.
9 Whoever leads a godly life, * 
he shall be my servant.
10 No deceitful person shall dwell in my house; *
the one who tells lies shall not tarry in my sight.
11 I shall soon destroy all the ungodly who are in the land, * 
that I may root out all evildoers from the city of the Lord.


Psalm 102
1 Hear my prayer, O Lord, *
and let my cry come unto you.
2 Hide not your face from me in the time of my trouble; * 
incline your ear to me when I call; O hear me, and very soon.
3 For my days are consumed like smoke, *
and my bones are burnt up as in a furnace.
4 My heart is smitten and withered like grass, * 
so that I forget to eat my bread.
5 Because of the voice of my groaning, *
my bones will scarcely cleave to my flesh.
6 I have become like an owl in the wilderness * 
and like a screech-owl among the ruins.
7 I am solitary, and lie sleepless because of my groaning; * 
I am like a sparrow that sits alone upon the housetop.
8 My enemies revile me all day long, *
and those who are enraged against me conspire to do me hurt.
9 For I have eaten ashes as if they were bread * 
and mingled my drink with weeping,
10 Because of your indignation and wrath; *
for you have taken me up and cast me down.
11 My days are gone like a shadow, * 
and I am withered like grass.
12 But you, O Lord, shall endure for ever, *
and your remembrance throughout all generations.
13 You shall arise and have mercy upon Zion, *
for it is time for you to have mercy upon her; 
         indeed, the time has come.
14 For your servants love her very stones, *
and are moved to pity to see her in the dust.
15 The nations shall fear your Name, O Lord, * 
and all the kings of the earth your majesty,
16 When the Lord shall build up Zion, * 
and when his glory shall appear,
17 When he turns to the prayer of the destitute * 
and despises not their plea.
18 This shall be written for those that come after, *
and a people that shall yet be born shall praise the Lord.
19 For he has looked down from his sanctuary; *
from the heavens the Lord has beheld the earth;
20 That he might hear the groanings of those who are in captivity,*
and deliver those who are condemned to die;
21 That they may declare the Name of the Lord in Zion, * 
and his praises in Jerusalem;
22 When the peoples are gathered together, * 
and the kingdoms also, to serve the Lord.
23 He brought down my strength before my time, * 
and shortened my days.
24 But I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days; *
for your years endure throughout all generations.
25 You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, * 
and the heavens are the work of your hands.
26 They shall perish, but you shall endure; * 
they all shall wear out, as does a garment;
27 And as a garment you shall change them, 
    and they shall be changed; *
but you are the same, and your years shall not fail.
28 The children of your servants shall continue, * 
and their seed shall stand fast in your sight.


Psalm 103
1 Praise the Lord, O my soul, *
and all that is within me, praise his holy Name.
2 Praise the Lord, O my soul, * 
and forget not all his benefits;
3 Who forgives all your sin *
and heals all your infirmities;
4 Who saves your life from the pit *
and crowns you with mercy and loving-kindness;
5 Who satisfies you with good things, * 
renewing your youth like an eagle’s.
6 The Lord executes righteousness and judgment * 
for all those who are oppressed with wrong.
7 He showed his ways to Moses, *
his works to the children of Israel.
8 The Lord is full of compassion and mercy, * 
long-suffering and of great goodness.
9 He will not always chide us, *
neither will he keep his anger for ever.
10 He has not dealt with us according to our sins, * 
nor rewarded us according to our wickedness.
11 For as the heavens are high above the earth, *
so great is his mercy also toward those who fear him.
12 As far as the east is from the west, * 
so far has he set our sins from us.
13 As a father pities his own children, *
so is the Lord merciful to those who fear him.
14 For he knows whereof we are made; *
he remembers that we are but dust.
15  The days of man are as grass; *
he flourishes as a flower of the field.
16 For as soon as the wind goes over it, it is gone, * 
and its place shall know it no more.
17 But the merciful goodness of the Lord endures 
    for ever and ever upon those who fear him, *
and his righteousness upon children’s children;
18 Even upon those who keep his covenant *
and think upon his commandments to do them.
19 The Lord has prepared his throne in heaven, * 
and his kingdom rules over all.
20 O praise the Lord, you angels of his, you that excel in strength, *
you that fulfill his commandment, 
         and hearken unto the voice of his words.
21  O praise the Lord, all you his hosts, * 
you servants of his that do his pleasure.
22 O speak good of the Lord, all you works of his, 
    in all places of his dominion; *
praise the Lord, O my soul.


Psalm 104
1 Praise the Lord, O my soul. *
O Lord my God, you have become exceedingly glorious; 
         you are clothed with majesty and honor.
2 You clothe yourself with light as with a garment, * 
and spread out the heavens like a curtain.
3 You lay the beams of your chambers in the waters, *
and make the clouds your chariot, 
         and walk upon the wings of the wind.
4 You make winds your messengers, * 
and flames of fire your ministers.
5 You laid the foundations of the earth, * 
that it never should move at any time.
6 You cover it with the deep as with a garment; * 
the waters stand above the hills.
7 At your rebuke they fled; *
at the voice of your thunder they hastened away.
8 They went up as high as the hills, 
    and down to the valleys beneath, *
even to the place you had appointed for them.
9 You have set bounds for them which they shall not pass; * 
neither shall they again cover the earth.
10 You send the springs into the rivers, * 
which run among the hills.
11 All beasts of the field drink thereof, *
and the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
12 Beside them shall the birds of the air have their habitation * 
and sing among the branches.
13 You water the hills from above; *
the earth is filled with the fruit of your works.
14 You bring forth grass for the cattle, * 
and plants for the service of mankind,
15 That they may bring food out of the earth, 
    and wine that makes glad the heart, *
and oil to make a cheerful countenance, 
         and bread to strengthen the heart.
16 The trees of the Lord also are full of sap, *
even the cedars of Lebanon which he planted,
17 Wherein the birds make their nests, *
and the fir trees are a dwelling for the stork.
18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats, * 
and so are the stony cliffs for the rock badgers.
19 You appointed the moon to mark the seasons, * 
and the sun knows its going down.
20 You make darkness that it may be night, * 
in which all the beasts of the forest move.
21 The lions, roaring after their prey, * 
seek their meat from God.
22 The sun arises, and they go away together, * 
and lay themselves down in their dens.
23 Man goes forth to his work, *
and to his labor until the evening.
24 O Lord, how manifold are your works; *
in wisdom you made them all; the earth is full of your creatures.
25 So is the great and wide sea also, *
in which are things creeping innumerable, 
         creatures both small and great.
26 There go the ships, and there is that Leviathan, * 
whom you made to take its pleasure therein.
27 These all wait upon you, *
that you may give them food in due season.
28 When you give it to them, they gather it, *
and when you open your hand, they are filled with good things.
29 When you hide your face, they are troubled; *
when you take away their breath, they die, 
         and are turned again to their dust.
30 When you let your breath go forth, they shall be made, * 
and you shall renew the face of the earth.
31 The glorious majesty of the Lord shall endure for ever; * 
the Lord shall rejoice in his works.
32 He looks at the earth and it trembles; *
if he even touches the hills, they shall smoke.
33 I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live; *
I will praise my God while I have my being.
34 And so shall my words please him; *
my joy shall be in the Lord.
35 As for sinners, they shall perish from the earth, 
    and the ungodly shall come to an end. *
Praise the Lord, O my soul. Praise the Lord.


Psalm 105
1 Give thanks unto the Lord and call upon his Name; * 
tell the peoples what things he has done.
2 O let your songs be of him, and praise him, *
and let your speech be of all his wondrous works.
3 Rejoice in his holy Name; *
let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.
4 Seek the Lord and his strength; * 
seek his face evermore.
5 Remember the marvelous works that he has done, * 
his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,
6 O seed of Abraham his servant, * 
O children of Jacob his chosen.
7 He is the Lord our God; *
his judgments are in all the world.
8 He has always been mindful of his covenant, *
and the promise that he made to a thousand generations,
9 Even the covenant that he made with Abraham, * 
and the oath that he swore to Isaac,
10 Which he appointed to Jacob for a law, * 
and to Israel for an everlasting testament,
11 Saying, “To you will I give the land of Canaan * to be the portion of your inheritance.”
12 When there were yet but a few of them, * 
and they were strangers in the land,
13 And they wandered from nation to nation, * 
and from one kingdom to another,
14 He allowed no one to do them wrong, * 
but reproved even kings for their sakes:
15 “Do not touch my Anointed, * 
and do my prophets no harm.”
16 Moreover, he called for a famine in the land * 
and destroyed all the provision of bread.
17 But he had sent a man before them: * 
Joseph, who was sold to be a bondservant,
18 Whose feet they hurt in the stocks; * 
they put a iron collar around his neck.
19 Until the time came that his sayings were fulfilled, * 
the word of the Lord tried him.
20 The king sent and delivered him; *
the ruler of the people let him go free.
21 He made him lord over his house, * 
and ruler of all his possessions,
22 That he might instruct his princes according to his will * 
and teach his elders wisdom.
23 Israel also came into Egypt, *
and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.
24 And he increased his people exceedingly, *
and made them stronger than their enemies,
25 Whose heart he turned, so that they hated his people, * 
and dealt deceitfully with his servants.
26 Then he sent Moses his servant, * 
and Aaron whom he had chosen,
27 And they worked his signs among them, * 
and wonders in the land of Ham.
28 He sent darkness, and it was dark; *
but they were not obedient to his word.
29 He turned their waters into blood * 
and caused their fish to die.
30 Their land brought forth frogs, * 
even in their kings’ chambers.
31 He spoke the word, and there came all manner of flies, * 
and gnats in all their borders.
32 He gave them hailstones for rain, * 
and flames of fire in their land.
33 He smote their vines also, and their fig trees, *
and destroyed the trees that were in their borders.
34 He spoke the word, and the grasshoppers came, 
    and locusts innumerable, *
which ate up all the grass in their land 
         and devoured the fruit of their ground.
35 He smote all the firstborn in their land, * 
even the firstfruits of all their strength.
36 He brought forth Israel with silver and gold; *
in all their tribes there was not one who stumbled.
37 Egypt was glad at their departing, * 
for they were afraid of them.
38 He spread out a cloud to be a covering, * 
and fire to give light in the night season.
39 At their desire he brought quail, *
and he filled them with the bread of heaven.
40 He opened the rock, and the waters flowed out, * 
so that rivers ran in the dry places.
41 For he remembered his holy promise * 
and Abraham his servant.
42 And he brought forth his people with joy, * 
and his chosen ones with gladness;
43 And gave them the lands of the nations, *
and they took the labors of the peoples in possession,
44 That they might keep his statutes *
and observe his laws. Praise the Lord.


Psalm 106
1 O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious, * 
and his mercy endures for ever.
2 Who can express the mighty acts of the Lord, * 
or show forth all his praise?
3 Blessed are those who act with justice, * 
and who always do righteousness.
4 Remember me, O Lord, 
    according to the favor that you show to your people; *
O visit me with your salvation,
5 That I may see the felicity of your chosen, *
and rejoice in the gladness of your people, 
         and give thanks with your inheritance.
6 We have sinned like our fathers; *
we have done wrong and dealt wickedly.
7 Our fathers regarded not your wonders in Egypt, 
    neither did they keep your great goodness in remembrance, *
but were disobedient at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
8 Nevertheless, he saved them for his Name’s sake, * 
that he might make his power known.
9 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up; *
so he led them through the deep as through a wilderness.
10 And he saved them from the adversary’s hand, * 
and delivered them from the hand of the enemy.
11 As for those who troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them;* 
there was not one of them left.
12 Then they believed his words * 
and sang praises unto him.
13 But soon they forgot his works *
and would not wait for his counsel.
14 A craving came upon them in the wilderness, * 
and they tempted God in the desert.
15 So he gave them their desire, *
and sent leanness into their soul.
16 They were envious of Moses also in the camp, * 
and of Aaron the holy one of the Lord.
17 So the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan * 
and covered the company of Abiram,
18 And fire was kindled in their company; * 
the flame burnt up the ungodly.
19 They made a calf in Horeb *
and worshipped a molten image.
20 Thus they exchanged their glory*
for the image of a calf that feeds on hay.
21 And they forgot God their Savior * 
who had done great things in Egypt,
22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, * 
and fearful things by the Red Sea.
23 So he said he would have destroyed them, 
    had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the gap *
to turn away his wrathful indignation, 
         lest he should destroy them.
24 Then they scorned that pleasant land * 
and gave no credence to his word,
25 But murmured in their tents *
and did not hearken to the voice of the Lord.
26 Then he lifted up his hand against them * 
to overthrow them in the wilderness,
27 To cast out their seed among the nations, * 
and to scatter them in all the lands.
28 They joined themselves to Baal-Peor * 
and ate the offerings to the dead.
29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their wanton deeds, * 
and the plague broke out among them.
30 Then Phineas stood up and interceded, * 
and so the plague was ended;
31 And that was counted to him as righteousness * 
among all generations for evermore.
32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, * 
so that he punished Moses for their misdeeds;
33 For they provoked him to anger, *
so that he spoke rashly with his lips.
34 Neither did they destroy the peoples * 
as the Lord commanded them,
35 But intermingled among the nations * 
and learned their heathen ways,
36 So that they worshipped their idols, 
    which became a snare to them; *
they offered their sons and their daughters to demons,
37 And shed innocent blood, 
    even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, *
whom they offered to the idols of Canaan; 
         and the land was defiled with blood.
38 Thus were they defiled by their own works * 
and went whoring with their own deeds.
39 Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, *
and he abhorred his own inheritance.
40 And he gave them over into the hands of the nations, * 
and those who hated them were lords over them.
41 Their enemies oppressed them * 
and held them in subjection.
42 Many a time did he deliver them, *
but they rebelled against him through their own devices, 
         and were brought down in their wickedness.
43 Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity, * 
when he heard their lamentation,
44 He remembered his covenant and pitied them, 
    according to the multitude of his mercies; *
he made all those who led them away captive to pity them.
45 Deliver us, O Lord our God, 
    and gather us from among the nations, *
that we may give thanks to your holy Name 
         and make our boast of your praise.
46 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting 
    and world without end, *
and let all the people say, “Amen.” Praise the Lord.


Psalm 107
1 O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious, * 
and his mercy endures for ever.
2 Let those whom the Lord has redeemed give thanks, * 
whom he has delivered from the hand of the enemy,
3 And gathered them out of the lands, 
    from the east and from the west, *
from the north and from the south.
4 They went astray in the wilderness, even in the desert, * 
and found no city to dwell in;
5 They were hungry and thirsty, *
and their soul fainted within them.
6 Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, * 
and he delivered them from their distress.
7 He led them forth by a straight path *
until they came to a city where they might dwell.
8 Oh, that they would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness *
and declare the wonders that he does for the children of men!
9 For he satisfies the empty soul *
and fills the hungry soul with goodness.
10 Some sat in darkness, and in the shadow of death, * 
being bound fast in misery and iron,
11 Because they rebelled against the words of God *
and lightly regarded the counsel of the Most High.
12 He also brought down their heart with heaviness; * 
they fell down, and there was none to help them.
13 Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, * 
and he delivered them out of their distress.
14 For he brought them out of darkness, 
    and out of the shadow of death, *
and broke their bonds asunder.
15 Oh, that they would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness *
and declare the wonders that he does for the children of men!
16 For he has broken the gates of brass * 
and shattered the bars of iron asunder.
17 The foolish were plagued for their offense * 
and because of their wickedness.
18 Their soul abhorred all manner of food, * 
and they were even close to death’s door.
19 So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, * 
he delivered them out of their distress.
20 He sent his word and healed them, *  
and they were saved from destruction.
21 Oh, that they would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness *
and declare the wonders that he does for the children of men!
22 That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving * 
and tell of his works with gladness!
23 Those who go down to the sea in ships, *
who carry out their business in great waters,
24 They behold the works of the Lord * 
and his wonders in the deep.
25 For at his word the stormy wind arises, * 
which lifts up the waves.
26 They are carried up to heaven and down again to the deep; * 
their soul melts away because of the trouble.
27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, * 
and are at their wits’ end.
28 So when they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, * 
he delivers them out of their distress.
29 For he makes the storm to cease, * 
so that the waves are still.
30 Then they are glad, because they are at rest, *
and so he brings them into the haven where they desire to be.
31 Oh, that they would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness *
and declare the wonders that he does for the children of men!
32 That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people *
and praise him in the seat of the elders!
33 He turns rivers into a wilderness *
and water-springs into thirsty ground.
34 A fruitful land he makes barren, *
because of the wickedness of those who dwell there.
35 Again, he makes the wilderness into pools of water * 
and dry ground into water-springs;
36 And there he sets the hungry *
that they may build a city to dwell in,
37 That they may sow their land, and plant vineyards * 
to yield the fruits of increase.
38 He blesses them, so that they multiply exceedingly, * 
and does not allow their cattle to decrease.
39 And again, when they are diminished and brought low, * 
through oppression, through any plague or trouble,
40 Though he pours contempt on princes *
and lets them wander in the pathless wilderness,
41 Yet he helps the poor out of misery *
and increases their households like a flock of sheep.
42 The righteous will consider this and rejoice, *
and the mouth of all wickedness shall be stopped.
43 Whoever is wise will ponder these things, *
and shall understand the loving-kindness of the Lord.


Psalm 108
1 O God, my heart is fixed, my heart is firmly fixed; *
I will sing and give praise with the best that I have.
2 Awake my soul, awake lute and harp; * 
I myself will awaken the dawn.
3 I will give thanks unto you, O Lord, among the peoples, * 
and I will sing praises unto you among the nations.
4 For the greatness of your mercy reaches to the heavens, * 
and your faithfulness to the clouds.
5 Exalt yourself, O God, above the heavens; * 
let your glory be over all the earth.
6  That your beloved may be delivered, *
save me by your right hand, and answer me.
7 God has spoken in his holiness: *
“I will rejoice and divide Shechem, 
         and parcel out the valley of Succoth.
8 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; *
Ephraim also is the helmet for my head; Judah is my scepter.
9 Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast my shoe; * 
over Philistia will I triumph.”
10 Who will lead me into the strong city, * 
and who will bring me into Edom?
11 Have you not forsaken us, O God? *
And will you not, O God, go forth with our hosts?
12 O help us against the enemy, * 
for vain is the help of man.
13 Through God we shall do great acts, *
for it is he who shall tread down our enemies.


Psalm 109
1 Hold not your tongue, O God of my praise, *
for the mouth of the ungodly, 
         the mouth of the deceitful is opened upon me.
2 They have spoken against me with false tongues; *
they encompassed me with words of hatred, 
         and fought against me without a cause.
3 In return for the love that I had for them, 
    they have become my adversaries; *
but I give myself to prayer.
4 Thus have they rewarded me evil for good, * 
and hatred for my love.
5 Set an ungodly man to be ruler over him, * 
and let an accuser stand at his right hand.
6 When judgment is given, let him be condemned, * 
and let sentence be passed on him for guilt.
7 Let his days be few, *
and let another take his office.
8 Let his children be fatherless * 
and his wife a widow.
9 Let his children be vagabonds and beg their bread; * 
let them be driven out, even from desolate places.
10 Let the creditor consume all that he has, * 
and let strangers take his labor for spoil.
11 Let there be no one to pity him, *
nor to have compassion upon his fatherless children.
12 Let his posterity be destroyed, *
and in the next generation let his name be blotted out.
13 Let the wickedness of his fathers be held 
    in remembrance in the sight of the Lord, *
and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
14 Let them be always before the Lord, *
that he may root out the memorial of them from the earth;
15 Because he was not minded to do good, *
but persecuted to death the poor and needy, 
         and those who were brokenhearted.
16 His delight was in cursing; let curses come upon him; * 
he loved not blessing; therefore let it be far from him.
17 He clothed himself with cursing as with a garment, * 
so let it soak into his body like water, and like oil into his bones.
18 Let it be to him as the cloak that he has on * 
and as the belt that he always wears.
19 Let this be the recompense from the Lord to my enemies * 
and to those who speak evil against my soul.
20 But deal with me, O Lord God, according to your Name; * 
for sweet is your mercy.
21 O deliver me, for I am helpless and poor, * 
and my heart is wounded within me.
22 I disappear like the shadow that lengthens, * 
and am shaken off like a grasshopper.
23 My knees are weak through fasting; *
my flesh is grown lean for want of nourishment.
24 I have become a reproach to them; *
when they look on me, they shake their heads.
25 Help me, O Lord my God; *
save me according to your mercy;
26 And they shall know that this is your hand, * 
and that you, O Lord, have done it.
27 Though they curse, yet you bless; *
let them be confounded who rise up against me, 
         but let your servant rejoice.
28 Let my adversaries be clothed with shame, *
and let them cover themselves with their own disgrace 
         as with a cloak.
29 As for me, I will give great thanks unto the Lord with my mouth, *
and praise him among the multitude;
30 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, * 
to save their souls from the unrighteous judges.
Psalm 110
1 The Lord said unto my Lord, “Sit at my right hand,* 
until I make your enemies your footstool.”
2 The Lord shall send the scepter of your power out of Zion: * 
“Rule in the midst of your enemies.”
3 In the day of your power the people, in holy raiment, 
    shall offer you freewill offerings; *
from the womb of the morning, 
         the dew of your youth belongs to you.
4 The Lord has sworn and will not recant: *
You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.
5 The Lord at your right hand *
shall smite kings in the day of his wrath.
6 He shall judge the nations; *
he shall fill the lands with dead bodies, 
         and strike down heads over many countries.
7 He shall drink from the brook by the way;* 
therefore shall he lift up his head.


Psalm 111
1 Praise the Lord. 
    I will give thanks unto the Lord with my whole heart, *
in the company of the upright and among the congregation.
2 The works of the Lord are great, *
sought out by all who have pleasure in them.
3 His work is worthy to be praised and held in honor, * 
and his righteousness endures for ever.
4 He has made his marvelous works to be had in remembrance; * 
The Lord is gracious and merciful.
5 He has given food to those who fear him; * 
he shall ever be mindful of his covenant.
6 He has shown his people the power of his works, * 
that he may give them the heritage of the nations.
7 The works of his hands are faithfulness and justice; * 
all his commandments are true.
8 They stand fast for ever and ever * 
and are done in truth and equity.
9 He sent redemption to his people; 
    he has commanded his covenant for ever; *
holy and awesome is his Name.
10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; *
a good understanding have all those who live accordingly; 
         his praise endures for ever.


Psalm 112
1   Praise the Lord! Blessed is the one who fears the Lord, * 
who has great delight in his commandments.
2 His seed shall be mighty in the land; *
the generation of the faithful shall be blessed.
3 Riches and plenteousness shall be in his house, * 
and his righteousness shall endure for ever.
4 For the upright, there rises light in the darkness; * 
he is merciful, loving, and righteous.
5 It is good for him to be generous in lending * 
and to guide his words with discretion.
6 For he shall never be moved, *
and the righteous shall be kept in everlasting remembrance.
7 He will not be afraid of any evil tidings, *
for his heart is steadfast and trusts in the Lord.
8 His heart is established, and will not fear; *
at the last he shall see his desire upon his enemies.
9 He has given freely to the poor, *
and his righteousness endures for ever; 
         his horn shall be exalted with honor.
10 The ungodly shall see it, and shall be angry; *
he shall gnash his teeth, and waste away; 
         the desire of the ungodly shall perish.


Psalm 113
1 Praise the Lord. Sing praises, you servants of the Lord; * 
O praise the Name of the Lord.
2 Blessed be the Name of the Lord, * 
from this time forth for evermore.
3   The Lord’s Name be praised *
from the rising up of the sun to the going down of the same.
4 The Lord is high above all nations, * 
and his glory above the heavens.
5 Who is like the Lord our God, who has his dwelling so high, * 
and yet humbles himself to behold the things 
         that are in heaven and earth?
6 He takes up the lowly out of the dust, * 
and lifts the poor out of the ashes,
7 That he may set them with the princes, * 
even with the princes of his people.
8 He gives the barren woman a home to dwell in, * 
and makes her to be a joyful mother of children. Praise the Lord.


Psalm 114
1 When Israel came out of Egypt, *
and the house of Jacob 
         from among a people of a foreign tongue,
2 Judah was God’s sanctuary, * 
and Israel his dominion.
3 The sea beheld it and fled; * 
Jordan was driven back.
4 The mountains skipped like rams, * 
and the little hills like young sheep.
5 What ailed you, O sea, that you fled? * 
O Jordan, that you were driven back?
6 You mountains, that you skipped like rams, * 
and you little hills like young sheep?
7 Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, * 
at the presence of the God of Jacob,
8 Who turned the hard rock into a pool of water, * 
and the flint stone into a springing well.


Psalm 115
 1 Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, 
    but unto your Name give the praise, *
for your loving mercy and for your truth’s sake.
2 Why shall the nations say, * 
“Where now is their God?”
3 As for our God, he is in heaven; *
he has done whatsoever pleased him.
4 Their idols are silver and gold, * 
even the work of human hands.
5 They have mouths, but they speak not; * 
eyes have they, but they see not.
6 They have ears, but they hear not; * 
noses have they, but they smell not.
7 They have hands, but they feel not; 
    feet have they, but they walk not; *
neither is there any sound in their throat.
8 Those who make them are like them, *
and so are all who put their trust in them.
9 But you, O house of Israel, trust in the Lord; * 
he is their helper and defender.
10 You house of Aaron, put your trust in the Lord; * 
he is their helper and defender.
11 You who fear the Lord, put your trust in the Lord; * 
he is their helper and defender.
12 The Lord has been mindful of us, and he shall bless us; * 
he shall bless the house of Israel; 
         he shall bless the house of Aaron;
13 He shall bless those who fear the Lord, * 
both small and great together.
14 The Lord shall increase you more and more, * 
you and your children after you.
15 You are the blessed of the Lord, * 
who has made heaven and earth.
16  The heavens are the Lord’s; *
the earth has he given to the children of men.
17 The dead praise you not, O Lord, *
neither all those who go down into silence.
18 But we will praise the Lord, *
from this time forth for evermore. Praise the Lord.


Psalm 116
1 I love the Lord *
because he heard the voice of my prayer,
2 Because he inclined his ear to me; *
therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.
3 The snares of death encompassed me, 
    and the pains of the grave laid hold of me; *
I suffered trouble and sorrow.
4 Then I called upon the Name of the Lord: * 
“O Lord, I beseech you, deliver my soul.”
5 Gracious is the Lord and righteous; * 
indeed, our God is full of compassion.
6 The Lord preserves the simple; *
I was in misery, and he helped me.
7 Turn again to your rest, O my soul, * 
for the Lord has rewarded you.
8 You have delivered my soul from death, *
my eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling.
9 I will walk before the Lord * 
in the land of the living.
10 I believed, and therefore will I speak: “I am greatly troubled.” * 
I said in my haste, “All men are liars.”
11 What shall I give unto the Lord *
for all the benefits that he has done unto me?
12 I will lift up the cup of salvation *
and call upon the Name of the Lord.
13 I will pay my vows unto the Lord in the presence of all his people; *dear in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.
14 O Lord, I am your servant; *
I am your servant, and the child of your handmaid; 
         you have broken my bonds asunder.
15 I will offer you the sacrifice of thanksgiving * 
and will call upon the Name of the Lord.
16 I will pay my vows unto the Lord in the sight of all his people, *
in the courts of the Lord’s house, 
         even in the midst of you, O Jerusalem. Praise the Lord.


Psalm 117
1 O praise the Lord, all you nations; * 
praise him, all you peoples.
2 For great is his loving-kindness towards us, *
and the faithfulness of the Lord endures for ever. Praise the Lord.


Psalm 118
1 Give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious; * 
his mercy endures for ever.
2 Let Israel now confess that he is gracious, * 
that his mercy endures for ever.
3 Let the house of Aaron now confess * 
that his mercy endures for ever.
4 Indeed, let those who fear the Lord confess * 
that his mercy endures for ever.
5 I called upon the Lord in trouble, *
and the Lord heard me and set me free.
6 The Lord is on my side; *
I will not fear what man can do to me.
7 The Lord takes my side with those who help me; * 
therefore shall I look in triumph on my enemies.
8   It is better to trust in the Lord * 
than to put any confidence in man.
9 It is better to trust in the Lord *
than to put any confidence in princes.
10 All the nations encompass me; *
but in the Name of the Lord will I cut them off.
11 They hem me in on every side; indeed, 
    they hem me in on every side; *
but in the Name of the Lord will I cut them off.
12 They come about me like bees, 
    and blaze like fire among the thorns; *
but in the Name of the Lord I will cut them off.
13 I was thrust aside so that I almost fell; * 
but the Lord was my help.
14 The Lord is my strength and my song, * 
and has become my salvation.   
15 The voice of joy and deliverance 
    is in the dwellings of the righteous; *
the right hand of the Lord brings mighty things to pass.
16 The right hand of the Lord is exalted; *
the right hand of the Lord brings mighty things to pass.
17 I shall not die, but live, *
and declare the works of the Lord.
18 The Lord has chastened and corrected me, * 
but he has not given me over to death.
19 Open unto me the gates of righteousness, *
that I may go into them, and give thanks unto the Lord.
20 This is the gate of the Lord; *
the righteous shall enter into it.
21 I will thank you, for you have heard me, * 
and have become my salvation.
22 The same stone which the builders refused * 
has become the chief cornerstone.
23 This is the Lord’s doing, *
and it is marvelous in our eyes.
24 This is the day that the Lord has made; * 
we will rejoice and be glad in it.
25 Help me now, O Lord; *
O Lord, send us now prosperity
26 Blessed is he who comes in the Name of the Lord; * 
we bless you from the house of the Lord.
27 God is the Lord, who has shown us light; *
bind the sacrifice with cords, even to the horns of the altar.
28 You are my God, and I will thank you; * 
you are my God, and I will exalt you.
29 O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious; * 
his mercy endures for ever.


Psalm 119:1-32
1 Blessed are those who are undefiled in their ways, * 
and walk in the law of the Lord.
2 Blessed are those who keep his testimonies, * 
and seek him with their whole heart.
3 Even those who do no wickedness * 
and perfectly walk in his ways.
4 You have ordered your precepts *
that we should diligently keep them.
5 O that my ways were made so direct * 
that I might keep your statutes!
6 Then would I not be put to shame *
while I give heed unto all your commandments.
7 I will thank you with an upright heart, *
when I have learned your righteous judgments.
8 I will keep your statutes; *
O do not forsake me utterly.
9 How shall a young man cleanse his way? * 
By ruling himself according to your word.
10 With my whole heart I have sought you; *
O let me not go astray from your commandments.
11 Your words have I hidden within my heart, *
that I may not sin against you.
12 Blessed are you, O Lord; * 
teach me your statutes.
13 With my lips have I been telling *
of all the judgments of your mouth.
14 I have had greater delight in the way of your testimonies * 
than in all manner of riches.
15 I will meditate on your commandments * 
and have respect for all your ways.
16 My delight will be in your statutes, * 
and I will not forget your word.
17 O do well unto your servant, *
that I may live, and keep your word.
18 Open my eyes that I may see *
the wondrous things of your law.
19 I am a sojourner on earth; *
O hide not your commandments from me.
20 My soul is consumed with the fervent desire * 
that it always has for your judgments.
21 You have rebuked the proud, *
and cursed are those who stray from your commandments.
22 O turn from me shame and contempt, * 
for I have kept your testimonies.
23 Though princes sit and speak against me, *
yet will your servant meditate on your statutes.
24 For your testimonies are my delight * 
and they are my counselors.
25 My soul cleaves to the dust; *
O revive me, according to your word.
26 I have acknowledged my ways, and you heard me; * 
O teach me your statutes.
27 Make me to understand the way of your commandments, * 
and so shall I meditate on your wondrous works.
28 My soul melts away for heaviness; * 
comfort me according to your word.
29 Take from me the way of lying,* 
and graciously teach me your law.
30 I have chosen the way of truth, *
and your judgments have I set before me.
31 I hold fast to your testimonies; *
O Lord, let me not be put to shame.
32 I will run the way of your commandments *
when you enlarge my heart with understanding.

Psalm 119:33-72
33 Teach me, O Lord, the way of your statutes, * 
and I shall keep it to the end.
34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep your law; * 
indeed, I shall keep it with my whole heart.
35 Make me go in the path of your commandments, * 
for therein is my desire.
36 Incline my heart to your testimonies, * 
and not to covetous desires.
37 O turn away my eyes, lest they behold vanity, * 
and revive me in your ways.
38 Confirm your word to your servant, * 
and to all those who fear you.
39 Take away the reproach that I am afraid of, * 
for your judgments are good.
40 Behold, my delight is in your precepts; * 
O revive me in your righteousness.
41 Let your loving mercy come to me, O Lord, * 
even your salvation, according to your word.
42 So shall I answer those who taunt me,* 
for my trust is in your word.
43 O do not take the word of your truth utterly out of my mouth,* 
for my hope is in your judgments.
44 So shall I always keep your law, * 
even for ever and ever.
45 And I will walk at liberty, *
for I seek your commandments.
46 I will speak of your testimonies also, even before kings, * 
and will not be ashamed.
47 And my delight shall be in your commandments, * 
which I have loved exceedingly.
48 My hands also will I lift up to your commandments, * 
and I will meditate on your statutes.
49 O remember your word to your servant, *
in which you have caused me to put my trust.
50 This is my comfort in my trouble, * 
for your word has given me life.
51 The proud have held me exceedingly in derision, * 
yet I have not turned aside from your law.
52 For I have remembered, O Lord, your judgments from of old, * 
and by them I have received comfort.
53 I am filled with indignation, *
because of the ungodly who forsake your law.
54 Your statutes have been my songs * 
in the house of my pilgrimage.
55 I have thought upon your Name, O Lord, in the night-season,* 
and I have kept your law.
56 This has been my reward *
because I have kept your commandments.
57 You are my portion, O Lord; *
I have promised to keep your law.
58 I made my humble petition 
    in your presence with my whole heart; *
O be merciful to me, according to your word.
59 I have called my ways to remembrance * 
and turned my feet to your testimonies.
60 I made haste and did not delay * 
to keep your commandments.
61 The cords of the ungodly have encircled me, * 
but I have not forgotten your law.
62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks to you, * 
because of your righteous judgments.
63 I am a companion of all those who fear you * 
and keep your commandments.
64 The earth, O Lord, is full of your mercy; * 
O teach me your statutes.
65 O Lord, you have dealt graciously with your servant, * 
according to your word.
66 O teach me true understanding and knowledge, * 
for I have believed your commandments.
67 Before I was afflicted I went astray, * 
but now I keep your word.
68 You are good and gracious; * 
O teach me your statutes.
69 The proud have slandered me with lies, *
but I will keep your commandments with my whole heart.
70 Their heart has become gross with fatness, * 
but my delight is in your law.
71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted, * 
that I may learn your statutes.
72 The law of your mouth is dearer to me * 
than thousands in gold and silver.

Psalm 119:73-104
73 Your hands have made me and fashioned me; * 
O give me understanding, that I may learn your commandments.
74 Those who fear you will be glad when they see me, * 
because I have put my trust in your word.
75 I know, O Lord, that your judgments are right, * 
and that in your faithfulness you have caused me to be afflicted.
76 O let your merciful kindness be my comfort, * 
according to your word to your servant.
77 O let your loving mercies come to me, that I may live, * 
for your law is my delight.
78 Let the proud be put to shame, 
    for they go about wickedly to destroy me; *
but I will meditate on your commandments.
79 Let those who fear you turn to me, *
even those who know your testimonies.
80 O let my heart be sound in your statutes, * 
that I may never be put to shame.
81 My soul has longed for your salvation, *
and I have a good hope because of your word.
82 My eyes long sorely for your word, * 
saying, “O when will you comfort me?”
83 For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke, * 
yet I do not forget your statutes.
84 How many are the days of your servant? *
When will you execute judgment on those who persecute me?
85 The proud have dug pits for me; * 
they do not walk after your law.
86 All your commandments are true. *
They persecute me falsely: O Lord be my help.
87 They had almost made an end of me on earth, * 
but I have not forsaken your commandments.
88 O revive me with your loving-kindness, *
and so shall I keep the testimonies of your mouth.
89 O Lord, your word endures for ever; * 
it stands fast in heaven.
90 Your faithfulness remains from one generation to another; * 
you have laid the foundation of the earth, and it abides.
91 Surely your ordinances stand firm this day, * 
for all things are your servants.
92 If my delight had not been in your law, * 
I should have perished in my affliction.
93 I will never forget your commandments, * 
for with them you have enlivened me.
94 I am yours; O save me! *
For I have sought your commandments.
95 The ungodly lie in wait for me to destroy me, * 
but I will consider your testimonies.
96 I see that all things come to an end, *
but your commandment has no bounds.
97 Lord, what love I have for your law; * 
all the day long I meditate on it.
98 You, through your commandment, 
    have made me wiser than my enemies, *
for it is always with me.
99 I have more understanding than my teachers, * 
for your testimonies are my study.
100 I am wiser than the agéd, *
because I keep your commandments.
101 I have restrained my feet from every evil way, * 
that I may keep your word.
102 I have not turned aside from your judgments, * 
for you yourself have taught me.
103 O how sweet are your words to my taste; * 
indeed, sweeter than honey to my mouth.
104 Through your commandments I get understanding; * 
therefore I hate all evil ways.

Psalm 119:105-144
105 Your word is a lantern to my feet * 
and a light upon my path.
106 I have sworn and am steadfastly purposed * 
to keep your righteous judgments.
107 I am troubled above measure; *
revive me, O Lord, according to your word.
108 Let the freewill offerings of my mouth please you, O Lord, * 
and teach me your judgments.
109 My life is always in my hand, * 
yet I do not forget your law.
110 The ungodly have laid a snare for me, *
yet I have not strayed from your commandments.
111 Your testimonies have I claimed as my heritage for ever, * 
and why? They are the very joy of my heart.
112 I have applied my heart to fulfill your statutes always, * 
even unto the end.
113 I hate those who are double-minded, * 
but your law do I love.
114 You are my defense and shield, * 
and my trust is in your word.
115 Away from me, you wicked. *
I will keep the commandments of my God.
116 Establish me according to your word, that I may live, * 
and let me not be disappointed in my hope.
117 Hold me up, and I shall be safe; *
indeed, my delight shall be ever in your statutes.
118 You have trodden down all those who depart 
    from your statutes, *
for they only imagine deceit.
119 You put away all the ungodly of the earth like dross; * 
therefore I love your testimonies.
120 My flesh trembles for fear of you, * 
and I am afraid of your judgments.
121 I have done that which is lawful and right; * 
O give me not over to my oppressors.
122 Be surety for your servant’s good, * 
O let not the arrogant oppress me.
123 My eyes have wasted away with looking for your salvation, * 
and for the word of your righteousness.
124 O deal with your servant according to your loving mercy, * 
and teach me your statutes.
125 I am your servant; O grant me understanding, * 
that I may know your testimonies.
126 It is time for you, O Lord, to act, * 
for they have broken your law.
127 For I love your commandments above all things, * 
more than gold and precious stones.
128 Therefore I hold all your commandments to be right, * 
and all false ways I utterly abhor.
129 Your testimonies are wonderful; * 
therefore does my soul keep them.
130 When your word goes forth it gives light * 
and understanding to the simple.
131 I opened my mouth, and drew in my breath, * 
for my delight was in your commandments.
132 O look upon me, and be merciful unto me, *
as you always do for those who love your Name.
133 Order my steps according to your word, *
and so shall no wickedness have dominion over me.
134 O deliver me from those who deal wrongfully, * 
and so shall I keep your commandments.
135 Show the light of your countenance upon your servant, * 
and teach me your statutes.
136 My eyes gush out water *
because of those who do not keep your law.
137 Righteous are you, O Lord, * 
and true are your judgments.
138 The testimonies that you have commanded * 
are exceedingly righteous and true.
139 My zeal has even consumed me, *
because my enemies have forgotten your words.
140 Your word is tested to the uttermost, * 
and therefore your servant loves it.
141 I am small, and of no reputation, *
yet I do not forget your commandments.
142 Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, * 
and your law is the truth.
143 Trouble and heaviness have taken hold of me, * 
yet my delight is in your commandments.
144 The righteousness of your testimonies is everlasting; * 
O grant me understanding, and I shall live.

Psalm 119:145-176
145 I call with my whole heart. *
Hear me, O Lord; I will keep your statutes.
146 Even unto you do I call; *
help me, and I shall keep your testimonies.
147 Early in the morning do I cry unto you, * 
for in your word is my trust.
148 My eyes open before the night watches, * 
that I may meditate on your words.
149 Hear my voice, O Lord, according to your loving-kindness; * 
give me life according to your judgments.
150 They draw nigh who in malice persecute me, * 
and are far from your law.
151 Be near at hand, O Lord, *
for all your commandments are true.
152 Concerning your testimonies, I have known long ago * 
that you have founded them for ever.
153 O consider my adversity and deliver me, * 
for I do not forget your law.
154 Plead my cause and deliver me; *
give me life according to your word.
155 Salvation is far from the ungodly, * 
for they do not regard your statutes.
156 Great is your mercy, O Lord; *
give me life according to your judgments.
157 Many there are who trouble me and persecute me, * 
yet I do not swerve from your testimonies.
158 It grieves me when I see the transgressors, * 
because they do not keep your law.
159 Consider, O Lord, how I love your commandments; * 
O give me life according to your loving-kindness.
160 Your word is true from everlasting; *
all the judgments of your righteousness endure for evermore.
161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause, * 
but my heart stands in awe of your word.
162 I am as glad of your word *
as one who finds great spoils.
163 As for lies, I hate and abhor them, * 
but your law do I love.
164 Seven times a day do I praise you, * 
because of your righteous judgments.
165 Great is the peace they have who love your law * 
and find in it no stumbling block.
166 Lord, I have looked for your saving health * 
and have done your commandments.
167 My soul has kept your testimonies, * 
and I have loved them exceedingly.
168 I have kept your commandments and testimonies, * 
for all my ways are before you.
169 Let my complaint come before you, O Lord; * 
give me understanding, according to your word.
170 Let my supplication come before you; * 
deliver me, according to your word.
171 My lips shall pour forth your praise, * 
when you have taught me your statutes.
172 Surely my tongue shall sing of your word, * 
for all your commandments are righteous.
173 Let your hand be strong to help me, *
for I have chosen your commandments.
174 I have longed for your saving health, O Lord, *
and in your law is my delight.
175 O let my soul live and it shall praise you, * 
and let your judgments help me.
176 I have gone astray like a sheep that is lost; * 
O seek your servant, for I do not forget your commandments.


Psalm 120
1 When I was in trouble I called upon the Lord, * 
and he hearkened to my calling.
2 Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips * 
and from a deceitful tongue.
3 What reward shall be given or done unto you, O false tongue? *
Even mighty and sharp arrows, with hot burning coals.
4 Woe is me, that I am constrained to dwell in Meshech * 
and to have my habitation among the tents of Kedar.
5 My soul has long dwelt among those * 
who are enemies of peace.
6 I labor for peace, but when I speak to them of it, * 
they make themselves ready for battle.


Psalm 121
1 I will lift up my eyes unto the hills; * 
from whence comes my help?
2 My help comes from the Lord, * 
who has made heaven and earth.
3 He will not let your foot be moved, * 
and he who keeps you will not sleep.
4 Behold, he who keeps Israel * 
shall neither slumber nor sleep.
5 The Lord himself is your keeper; *
the Lord is your defense upon your right hand;
6 So that the sun shall not burn you by day, * 
neither the moon by night.
7 The Lord shall preserve you from all evil; * 
indeed, it is he who shall keep your soul.
8 The Lord shall preserve your going out and your coming in, * 
from this time forth for evermore.


Psalm 122
1 I was glad when they said unto me, *
“We will go into the house of the Lord.”
2  Now our feet are standing * 
within your gates, O Jerusalem.
3 Jerusalem is built as a city * 
that is at unity in itself.
4 For there the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord, * 
as was decreed for Israel, to give thanks unto the Name of the Lord.
5 For there is the throne of judgment, * 
even the throne of the house of David.
6 O pray for the peace of Jerusalem; * 
they shall prosper that love you.
7 Peace be within your walls *
and plenteousness within your palaces.
8 For my brethren and companions’ sakes, * 
I will wish you prosperity.
9  Indeed, because of the house of the Lord our God, * 
I will seek to do you good.


Psalm 123
1 Unto you I lift up my eyes, *
you who are enthroned in the heavens.
2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters, *
and as the eyes of a maiden to the hand of her mistress,
3 Even so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, * 
until he show us his favor.
4 Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us, * 
for we have suffered more than enough contempt.
5 Long has our soul suffered the scorn of the wealthy * 
and the spitefulness of the proud.


Psalm 124
1 If the Lord himself had not been on our side, now may Israel say: *
if the Lord himself had not been on our side, 
         when men rose up against us,
2 Then would they have swallowed us up alive, * 
when they were so wrathfully displeased with us;
3 Then the waters would have drowned us, 
    and the torrent gone over us; *
then the raging waters would have gone clean over us.
4 But praised be the Lord *
who has not given us over to be prey for their teeth.
5 We escaped like a bird out of the snare of the fowler; * 
the snare is broken, and we have been delivered.
6 Our help is in the Name of the Lord, * 
the maker of heaven and earth.




Psalm 125
1 Those who put their trust in the Lord shall be like Mount Zion, *
which cannot be moved, but stands fast for ever.
2 The hills stand about Jerusalem *
even as the Lord stands round about his people, 
         from this time forth for evermore.
3 For the scepter of the ungodly shall not rest 
    upon the land allotted to the righteous, *
lest the righteous put forth their hand to do wickedness.
4 Do good, O Lord, unto those who are good, * 
unto those who are good and true of heart.
5 As for those who turn aside to their own wicked ways, 
    the Lord shall lead them away with the evildoers; *
but peace shall be upon Israel.


Psalm 126
1 When the Lord overturned the captivity of Zion, * 
then were we like those who dream.
2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter * 
and our tongue with shouts of joy.
3 Then they said among the nations, *
“The Lord has done great things for them.”
4 Indeed, the Lord has done great things for us already, * 
whereof we rejoice.
5 Overturn our captivity, O Lord, *
as when streams refresh the deserts of the south.
6   Those who sow in tears * 
shall reap with songs of joy.
7 He who goes on his way weeping and bears good seed * 
shall doubtless come again with joy,
         and bring his sheaves with 


Psalm 127
1 Unless the Lord builds the house, * 
their labor is in vain who build it.
2 Unless the Lord keeps the city, * 
the watchman keeps vigil in vain.
3 It is in vain that you rise up early, 
    and take rest so late, and eat the bread of toil, *
for he gives to his beloved sleep.
4 Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord, *
and the fruit of the womb is a gift that comes from him.
5 Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, * 
so are the children of one’s youth.
6 Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them; *
he shall not be ashamed 
         when he speaks with his enemies in the gate.


Psalm 128
1 Blessed are all those who fear the Lord * 
and walk in his ways.
2 For you shall eat of the labors of your hands; *
it shall be well with you, and happy you shall be.
3 Your wife shall be as a fruitful vine * 
upon the walls of your house,
4 Your children like the olive branches * 
round about your table.
5 Indeed, thus shall the man be blessed * 
who fears the Lord.
6 May the Lord bless you out of Zion; *
may you see Jerusalem in prosperity all your life long.
7 May you see your children’s children, * 
and may there be peace upon Israel.


Psalm 129
1 “Many a time have they fought against me from my youth on,”* 
may Israel now say;
2 “Indeed, many a time have they afflicted me from my youth on,* 
but they have not prevailed against me.
3 The plowers plowed upon my back, * 
and made long furrows.
4 But the righteous Lord *
has hewn the snares of the ungodly in pieces.”
5 Let them be ashamed and turned backward, * 
as many as hate Zion.
6 Let them be as the grass growing upon the housetops, * 
which withers before it grows up,
7 Which does not fill the hand of the reaper, *
neither the bosom of him who binds up the sheaves,
8 So that those who go by say not so much as, 
    “The Lord prosper you. *
We bless you in the Name of the Lord.”


Psalm 130
1 Out of the deep have I called unto you, O Lord; * 
Lord, hear my voice.
2 O let your ears consider well *
the voice of my supplications.
3 If you, Lord, were to mark what is done amiss, * 
O Lord, who could abide it?
4 For there is mercy with you; * 
therefore you shall be feared.
5 I wait for the Lord; my soul waits for him; * 
in his word is my trust.
6 My soul waits for the Lord, *
more than watchmen for the morning, 
         more than watchmen for the morning.
7 O Israel, trust in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy, * 
and with him is plenteous redemption;
8 And he shall redeem Israel * 
from all their sins.


Psalm 131
1 O Lord, I am not haughty; * 
I have no proud looks.
2 I do not occupy myself with great matters, * 
or with things that are too high for me.
3 But I have stilled and quieted my soul, like a weaned child upon his mother’s breast; *
so is my soul quieted within me.
4 O Israel, trust in the Lord *
from this time forth for evermore.


Psalm 132
1 Lord, remember David, * 
and all his tribulations;
2 How he swore unto the Lord, *
and vowed a vow unto the Almighty God of Jacob:
3 “I will not come within the tabernacle of my house, * 
nor climb up into my bed;
4 I will not allow my eyes to sleep, nor my eyelids to slumber, * 
neither the temples of my head to take any rest,
5  Until I find a place for the temple of the Lord, * 
a habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.”
6 Lo, we heard of the ark at Ephrathah * 
and found it in the wood.
7 We will go into his tabernacle, *
and fall low on our knees before his footstool.
8 Arise, O Lord, into your resting-place, * 
you and the ark of your strength.
9 Let your priests be clothed with righteousness, * 
and let your saints sing with joy.
10 For your servant David’s sake, *
turn not away the presence of your Anointed.
11 The Lord has made a faithful oath unto David, * 
and he shall not shrink from it:
12 “Of the fruit of your body * 
shall I set upon your throne.
13 If your children will keep my covenant, 
    and my testimonies that I shall teach them, *
their children also shall sit upon your throne for evermore.”
14 For the Lord has chosen Zion for himself; * 
he has longed for her to be his habitation:
15 “This shall be my rest for ever; *
here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein.
16 I will bless her provisions with increase, * 
and will satisfy her poor with bread.
17 I will clothe her priests with salvation, * 
and her saints shall rejoice and sing.
18 There shall I make the horn of David flourish; * 
I have prepared a lantern for my Anointed.
19 As for his enemies, I shall clothe them with shame; * 
but upon his head shall his crown flourish.”


Psalm 133
1 Behold, how good and joyful a thing it is * 
when brethren dwell together in unity.
2 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, 
    that ran down upon the beard, *
even Aaron’s beard, and went down to the edges of his clothing,
3 Like the dew of Hermon, *
which falls upon the hills of Zion.
4 For there the Lord promised his blessing, * 
even life for evermore.


Psalm 134
1 Behold now, praise the Lord, * 
all you servants of the Lord,
2 You that stand by night in the house of the Lord, * 
even in the courts of the house of our God.
3 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary * 
and sing praises unto the Lord.
4 The Lord who made heaven and earth * 
give you blessing out of Zion.


Psalm 135
1 O praise the Lord. Praise the Name of the Lord; * 
offer praise, you servants of the Lord,
2 You who stand in the house of the Lord, * 
in the courts of the house of our God.
3 O praise the Lord, for the Lord is good; * 
sing praises unto his Name, for it is lovely.
4 For the Lord has chosen Jacob for himself * 
and Israel for his own possession.
5 For I know that the Lord is great, * 
and that our Lord is above all gods.
6 Whatsoever the Lord pleases he does, 
    in heaven and on earth, *
in the seas and in all the deep places.
7 He brings forth clouds from the ends of the earth *
and sends forth lightning with the rain, 
         bringing the wind out of his treasuries.
8 It was he who struck down the firstborn of Egypt, * 
both of man and beast.
9 He sent signs and wonders into the midst of you, 
    O land of Egypt, *
against Pharaoh and all his servants.
10 He smote many nations, * 
and slew mighty kings:
11 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og the king of Bashan, * 
and all the kingdoms of Canaan.
12 And he gave their land to be an inheritance, * 
an inheritance for Israel his people.
13 Your Name, O Lord, endures for ever; *
so does your renown, O Lord, from one generation to another.
14 For the Lord will avenge his people *
and have compassion upon his servants.
15 As for the idols of the nations, they are but silver and gold, *
the work of human hands.
16 They have mouths, but they speak not; * 
eyes have they, but they see not;
17 They have ears, and yet they hear not, * 
neither is there any breath in their mouths.
18 Those who make them are like them, *
and so are all who put their trust in them.
19 Praise the Lord, O house of Israel; * 
praise the Lord, O house of Aaron.
20 Praise the Lord, O house of Levi; *
you who fear the Lord, praise the Lord.
21 Praised be the Lord from Zion, *
who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise the Lord.


Psalm 136
1 O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious, * 
for his mercy endures for ever.
2 O give thanks unto the God of all gods, * 
for his mercy endures for ever.
3 O give thanks unto the Lord of all lords, * 
for his mercy endures for ever.
4 Who alone does great wonders, * 
for his mercy endures for ever.
5 Who by his excellent wisdom made the heavens, * 
for his mercy endures for ever.
6 Who laid out the earth above the waters, * 
for his mercy endures for ever.
7 Who made the great lights, *
for his mercy endures for ever;
8 The sun to rule the day, *
for his mercy endures for ever;
9 The moon and the stars to govern the night, * 
for his mercy endures for ever.
10 Who struck down the firstborn of Egypt, * 
for his mercy endures for ever;
11 And brought out Israel from among them, * 
for his mercy endures for ever;
12 With a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, * 
for his mercy endures for ever.
13 Who divided the Red Sea in two parts, * 
for his mercy endures for ever;
14 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it, * 
for his mercy endures for ever.
15 But as for Pharaoh and his host, 
    he overthrew them in the Red Sea, *
for his mercy endures for ever.
16 Who led his people through the wilderness, * 
for his mercy endures for ever.
17 Who smote great kings, *
for his mercy endures for ever;
18 And slew mighty kings, *
for his mercy endures for ever;
19  Sihon king of the Amorites, * 
for his mercy endures for ever;
20 And Og the king of Bashan, * 
for his mercy endures for ever;
21 And gave away their land for an inheritance, * 
for his mercy endures for ever;
22 Even for an inheritance for Israel his servant, * 
for his mercy endures for ever.
23 Who remembered us when we were in trouble, * 
for his mercy endures for ever;
24 And delivered us from our enemies, * 
for his mercy endures for ever.
25 Who gives food to all flesh, *
for his mercy endures for ever.
26 O give thanks unto the God of heaven, * 
for his mercy endures for ever.
27 O give thanks unto the Lord of lords * 
for his mercy endures for ever.


Psalm 137
1 By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept, * 
when we remembered you, O Zion.
2 As for our harps, we hung them up * 
upon the trees that are therein.
3 For those who led us away captive required of us a song 
    and melody in our heaviness: *
“Sing us one of the songs of Zion.”
4   How shall we sing the Lord’s song * 
in the land of our captivity?
5 If I forget you, O Jerusalem, *
let my right hand forget its skill.
6 If I do not remember you, 
    let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, *
if I prefer not Jerusalem above my dearest joy.
7 Remember the children of Edom, O Lord,  
    in the day of Jerusalem, *
how they said, “Down with it, down with it, 
         even to the ground.”
8 O daughter of Babylon, wasted with misery, *
happy shall be the one who rewards you 
         as you have done to us.
9 Blessed shall he be who takes your children * 
and throws them against the stones.


Psalm 138
1 I will give thanks to you, O Lord, with my whole heart; * 
even before the gods will I sing praises to you.
2 I will worship toward your holy temple and praise your Name 
    because of your loving-kindness and truth, * 
for you have magnified your Name 
        and your word above all things.
3 When I called upon you, you heard me * 
and gave me increase of strength.
4 All the kings of the earth shall praise you, O Lord, * 
for they have heard the words of your mouth.
5 They shall sing of the ways of the Lord, * 
that great is the glory of the Lord.
6 For though the Lord be high, yet he has respect for the lowly;* 
as for the proud, he beholds them from afar.
7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, yet shall you refresh me; * 
you shall stretch forth your hand upon the furiousness 
         of my enemies, and your right hand shall save me.
8 The Lord shall make good his loving-kindness toward me; * 
your mercy, O Lord, endures for ever; 
         despise not the works of your own hands.


Psalm 139
1 O Lord, you have searched me out and known me; * 
you know my sitting down and my rising up; 
         you understand my thoughts from afar.
2 You examine my path and my places of rest, * 
and are acquainted with all my ways.
3 Indeed, there is not a word on my tongue, * 
but you, O Lord, know it altogether.
4 You have enclosed me behind and before, * 
and have laid your hand upon me.
5 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me, * 
so excellent I cannot attain to it.
6 Where shall I go then from your Spirit, * 
or where shall I flee from your presence?
7 If I climb up to heaven, you are there; *
if I make my bed in the grave, you are there also.
8 If I take the wings of the morning *
and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
9 Even there shall your hand lead me, * 
and your right hand shall hold me.
10 If I say, “Surely the darkness shall cover me,” * 
then shall my night be turned to day.
11 Even the darkness is not dark to you, 
    and the night is as clear as the day; *
the darkness and the light to you are both alike.
12 For you yourself made my inmost parts; *
you knit me together in my mother’s womb.
13 I will give thanks to you, 
    for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; *
marvelous are your works, and my soul knows it very well.
14 My bones were not hidden from you *
when I was made in secret 
        and fashioned in the depths of the earth.
15 Your eyes beheld my substance, while I was yet unformed; * 
and in your book were all my members written,
16 Which day by day were fashioned, * 
when as yet there was none of them.
17 How dear to me are your thoughts, O God. * 
How great is the sum of them!
18 If I were to count them, 
    they would be more in number than the sand. *
When I wake up, I am present with you.
19 Oh, that you would slay the wicked, O God! * 
Depart from me, you bloodthirsty men.
20 For they speak unrighteously against you; * 
your enemies take your Name in vain.
21 Do I not hate those, O Lord, who hate you, *
and do I not loathe those who rise up against you?
22 Indeed, I hate them with a perfect hatred; * 
they have become my own enemies.
23 Search me, O God, and know my heart; * 
try me and examine my thoughts.
24 Look well if there be any way of wickedness in me, * 
and lead me in the way everlasting.


Psalm 140
1 Deliver me, O Lord, from evildoers, * 
and preserve me from the violent,
2 Who imagine evil in their hearts * 
and stir up strife all the day long.
3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; * 
adders’ poison is under their lips.
4 Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the ungodly; * 
preserve me from the violent, 
         who have purposed to overthrow my steps.
5 The proud have laid a snare for me 
    and spread out a net with cords; *
they have set traps in my way.
6 I said unto the Lord, “You are my God; * 
hear the voice of my prayers, O Lord.”
7 O Lord God, the strength of my salvation, * 
you have covered my head in the day of battle.
8  Let not the ungodly have their desire, O Lord; *
let not their evil imagination prosper, lest they be too proud.
9 Let not those who encompass me lift up their heads; * 
let the evil of their own lips consume them.
10 Let hot burning coals fall upon them; *
let them be cast into the fire and into the pit, 
         that they may never rise up again.
11 A slanderer shall not prosper upon the earth; *
evil shall hunt the wicked person to overthrow him.
12 I am sure that the Lord will avenge the poor * 
and maintain the cause of the helpless.
13 Surely, the righteous shall give thanks unto your Name, * 
and the just shall continue in your sight.


Psalm 141
1 Lord, I call upon you; hasten unto me, * 
and hear my voice when I cry unto you.
2 Let my prayer be set forth in your sight as incense, *
and let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice.
3 Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, * 
and keep the door of my lips.
4 O let not my heart be inclined to any evil thing; *
let me not be occupied in ungodly works 
         with those who work wickedness, 
              lest I eat of such things as please them.
5 Rather, let the righteous smite me, *
and in their loving-kindness reprove me.
6 But let not the oil of the unrighteous anoint my head; * 
while I live, I will pray against their wickedness.
7 Let their rulers be overthrown in stony places, * 
that they may hear my words, for they are sweet.
8 Let their bones lie scattered at the mouth of the grave, * 
as when the ploughman scatters the earth in furrows.
9 But my eyes look unto you, O Lord God; *
in you is my refuge; O do not cast out my soul.
10 Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, * 
and from the traps of the evildoers.
11 Let the ungodly fall into their own nets together, * 
and let me ever escape them.


Psalm 142
1 I cried unto the Lord with my voice; *
even unto the Lord I made my supplication.
2 I poured out my complaints before him, * 
and showed him my trouble.
3 When my spirit was in heaviness you knew my path; * 
in the way wherein I walked 
         they had secretly laid a snare for me.
4 I looked also to my right hand *
and saw there was no one who would know me.
5 I had no place to flee to, *
and no one cared for my soul.
6 I cried out to you, O Lord, and said, *
“You are my refuge, 
         and my portion in the land of the living.”
7   Consider my complaint, * 
for I am brought very low.
8 O deliver me from my persecutors, * 
for they are too strong for me.
9 Bring me out of prison, that I may give thanks unto your Name. *
When you show me your loving-kindness, then shall the righteous gather around me.


Psalm 143
1 Hear my prayer, O Lord, and consider my supplications; * 
hearken to me, for your truth and righteousness’ sake.
2 Enter not into judgment with your servant, *
for in your sight shall no one living be justified.
3 For the enemy has persecuted my soul; 
    he has smitten my life down to the ground; *
he has laid me in the darkness, 
         like those who have been long dead.
4 Therefore my spirit faints within me, * 
and my heart within me is desolate.
5 Yet I remember the time past; I muse upon all your works; * 
indeed, I meditate on the works of your hands.
6 I stretch forth my hands to you; *
my soul gasps for you as a thirsty land.
7 Hear me, O Lord, and very soon, for my spirit grows faint; * 
hide not your face from me, 
         lest I be like those who go down into the pit.
8 O let me hear your loving-kindness in the morning, 
    for in you have I put my trust; *
show me the way that I should walk in, 
         for I lift up my soul unto you.
9 Deliver me, O Lord, from my enemies; * 
for I flee unto you to hide me.
10 Teach me to do the thing that pleases you, 
    for you are my God;* 
let your loving Spirit lead me forth 
         into the land of righteousness.
11 Revive me, O Lord, for your Name’s sake; *
and for your righteousness’ sake 
         bring my soul out of trouble.
12 Of your goodness slay my enemies, *
and destroy all those who afflict my soul, 
         for I am your servant.


Psalm 144
1 Blessed be the Lord my strength, *
who teaches my hands to war and my fingers to fight,
2 My hope and my fortress, my stronghold and deliverer, 
    my defender in whom I trust, *
who subdues the peoples under me.
3 O Lord, what is man, 
    that you have shown such respect to him, *
or the son of man, that you so regard him?
4 Man is like a thing of nought; *
his time passes away like a shadow.
5 Bow your heavens, O Lord, and come down; * 
touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
6 Cast forth your lightning and scatter them; * 
shoot out your arrows and consume them.
7 Send down your hand from above; *
deliver me, and take me out of the great waters, 
         from the hand of strangers,
8 Whose mouth talks of vain things, *
and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
9 I will sing a new song unto you, O God, *
and sing praises unto you upon a ten-stringed lute.
10 You have given victory to kings *
and have delivered David your servant 
         from the peril of the sword.
11 Save me, and deliver me from the hand of strangers, * 
whose mouth talks of vain things, 
         and whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood;
12 That our sons may grow up as young plants, *
and that our daughters may be 
         as the polished corners of the temple,
13 That our storehouses may be full and plenteous 
    with all manner of gain, *
that our sheep may bring forth thousands 
         and ten thousands in our fields,
14 That our oxen may be strong to labor, 
    that there be no decay, * 
no leading into captivity, and no outcry in our streets.
15 Happy are the people of whom this is so; *
indeed, blessed are the people 
         who have the Lord for their God.
Psalm 145
1  I will magnify you, O God my King, *
and I will praise your Name for ever and ever.
2 Every day will I give thanks to you, *
and praise your Name for ever and ever.
3 Great is the Lord, and most worthy to be praised; * 
there is no end of his greatness.
4 One generation shall praise your works to another, * 
and shall declare your power.
5 As for me, 
    I will be talking of the glorious splendor of your majesty, *
and of all your wondrous works.
6 They shall speak of the might of your marvelous acts, * 
and I also will tell of your greatness.
7 The remembrance of your abundant goodness 
    shall they proclaim, *
and they shall sing of your righteousness.
8 The Lord is gracious and merciful, * 
long-suffering, and of great kindness.
9 The Lord is loving to everyone * 
and his mercy is over all his works.
10 All your works praise you, O Lord, *
and your faithful servants give thanks to you.
11 They speak of the glory of your kingdom * 
and talk of your power,
12 That your power may be known to the children of men, * 
even the glorious splendor of your kingdom.
13 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, *
and your dominion endures throughout all ages.
14 The Lord upholds all those who fall *
and lifts up all those who are bowed down.
15 The eyes of all wait upon you, O Lord, *
and you give them their food in due season.
16 You open wide your hand, *
and fill all things living with plenteousness.
17 The Lord is righteous in all his ways * 
and merciful in all his works.
18 The Lord is near to all those who call upon him, * 
to all who call upon him faithfully.
19 He will fulfill the desire of those who fear him; * 
he also will hear their cry and will help them.
20 The Lord preserves all those who love him, * 
but he will destroy all the ungodly.
21 My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord; * 
and let all flesh give thanks unto his holy Name 
         for ever and ever.
Psalm 146
1 Praise the Lord, O my soul; *
while I live I will praise the Lord.
2 Indeed, as long as I have my being, * 
I will sing praises unto my God.
3 Put not your trust in princes, nor in any child of man, * 
for there is no help in them.
4 For when one breathes his last, he shall return again to the earth; *
and in that day all his thoughts perish.
5 Blessed is the one who has the God of Jacob for his help * 
and whose hope is in the Lord his God,
6 Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is therein; * 
who keeps his promise for ever;
7 Who does right to those who suffer wrong; * 
and who feeds the hungry.
8 The Lord sets prisoners free; *
the Lord gives sight to the blind.
9 The Lord helps those who have fallen; * 
the Lord loves the righteous.
10 The Lord cares for the strangers in the land; he defends the fatherless and widow; *
but the way of the ungodly he makes crooked.
11 The Lord shall be King for evermore, *
even your God, O Zion, throughout all generations. Praise the Lord.


Psalm 147
1 Praise the Lord, for it is a good thing to sing praises 
    unto our God; *
indeed, a joyful and pleasant thing it is to be thankful.
2 The Lord builds up Jerusalem, *
and gathers together the outcasts of Israel.
3 He heals those who are broken in heart, * 
and binds up their wounds.
4 He counts the number of the stars, * 
and calls them all by their names.
5 Great is our Lord, and great is his power; * 
indeed, his wisdom is infinite.
6 The Lord lifts up the meek, *
and brings the ungodly down to the ground.
7 O sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving; * sing praises with the harp unto our God,
8 Who covers the heavens with clouds, 
    and prepares rain for the earth, *
and makes the grass to grow upon the mountains, 
         and plants for the use of men;
9 Who gives food to the cattle *
and feeds the young ravens that call upon him.
10 He has no pleasure in the strength of a horse; * 
neither does he delight in any man’s strength.
11  But the Lord’s delight is in those who fear him * 
and put their trust in his mercy.
12 Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; * 
praise your God, O Zion.
13 For he has made strong the bars of your gates * 
and has blessed your children within you.
14 He makes peace in your borders *
and fills you with the finest of wheat.
15 He sends forth his commandment upon the earth, * 
and his word runs very swiftly.
16 He gives snow like wool *
and scatters the white frost like ashes.
17 He casts forth his ice like crumbs; * 
who is able to abide his frost?
18 He sends out his word and melts them; *
he blows with his wind, and the waters flow.
19 He declares his word unto Jacob, *
his statutes and ordinances unto Israel.
20 He has not dealt so with other nations; *
neither have they knowledge of his laws. Praise the Lord.


Psalm 148
1 Praise the Lord. O praise the Lord of heaven; * 
praise him in the heights.
2 Praise him, all you angels of his; * 
praise him, all his host.
3   Praise him, sun and moon; * 
praise him, all you stars of light.
4 Praise him, all you highest heavens, *
and you waters that are above the heavens.
5 Let them praise the Name of the Lord, *
for he spoke the word, and they were made; 
         he commanded, and they were created.
6 He has made them stand fast for ever and ever; *
he has given them a law which shall not be broken.
7  Praise the Lord upon earth, * 
you sea monsters and all deeps;
8 Fire and hail, snow and fog, *
wind and storm, fulfilling his word;
9 Mountains and all hills, * 
fruitful trees and all cedars;
10 Beasts and all cattle, *
creeping things and birds of the air;
11 Kings of the earth and all peoples, * 
princes and all rulers of the world;
12 Young men and maidens, *
old men and children together.
13 Let them praise the Name of the Lord; *
for his Name only is excellent, 
         and his praise above heaven and earth.
14 He shall exalt the horn of his people; 
    all his faithful shall praise him, *
the children of Israel, the people who are near him. 
         Praise the Lord.


Psalm 149
1 Praise the Lord. O sing unto the Lord a new song; * 
let the congregation of the faithful praise him.
2 Let Israel rejoice in the one who made him, *
and let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
3 Let them praise his Name in the dance; *
let them sing praises unto him with timbrel and harp.
4 For the Lord has pleasure in his people *
and gives victory to those who are oppressed.
5 Let the faithful be joyful with glory; * 
let them rejoice upon their beds.
6 Let the praises of God be in their mouth * 
and a two-edged sword in their hands,
7 To inflict vengeance on the nations, * 
and to rebuke the peoples,
8 To bind their kings in chains, *
and their nobles with links of iron,
9 That they may execute judgment upon them, as it is written; * 
this is the honor of all his servants. Praise the Lord.


Psalm 150
1 Praise the Lord. Praise God in his holiness; * 
praise him in the firmament of his power.
2 Praise him for his mighty acts; *
praise him for his excellent greatness.
3 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet; * 
praise him upon the lute and harp.
4 Praise him with the timbrels and dances; * 
praise him upon the strings and pipe.
5 Praise him with the resounding cymbals; * 
praise him with the loud cymbals.
6 Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. * 
O praise the Lord.
